Please ask any questions in the #help channel on the Slack linked above.\\n\\nSystem requirements:\\nmacOS High Sierra (10.13) or newer. Talon is a universal2 build with native Apple Silicon support.\\nLinux / X11 (Ubuntu 18.04+, and most modern distros), Wayland support is currently limited to XWayland\\nWindows 8 or newer\\n\\nPowerful voice control - Talon comes with a free speech recognition engine, and it is also compatible with Dragon with no additional setup.\\n\\nMultiple algorithms for eye tracking mouse control (depends on a single Tobii 4C, Tobii 5 or equivalent eye tracker)\\n\\nNoise recognition system (pop and hiss). Many more noises coming soon.\\n\\nScriptable with Python 3 (via embedded CPython, no need to install or configure Python on your host system).\\n\\nTalon is very modular and adaptable - you can use eye tracking without speech recognition, or vice versa.\\n\\nGetting Started¶\\n\\nDownload and install Talon for your operating system.\\n\\nRun the Talon app.\\n\\nOpen the Talon Home directory.\\nThis is %APPDATA%\\\\Talon on Windows, and ~/.talon on macOS/Linux. (Talon has a menu in your system tray near the clock, you can use Scripting -> Open ~/.talon as a shortcut open Talon Home).\\n\\nAdd some scripts to ~/.talon/user to add voice commands and other behaviour to Talon (see the Getting Scripts section below). Your user scripts control all of the voice commands in Talon, so Talon won’t recognize any commands until you add some scripts.\\n\\nInstall Conformer using Talon’s Speech Recognition menu.\\n\\nGo to Scripting -> View Log in the menu for debug output, or Scripting -> Open REPL for a Python command line.\\n\\nGetting Scripts¶\\n\\nThe best way to get started right now is to clone knausj_talon into your ~/.talon/user directory. Ask in #help on Slack if you run into any problems.\\n\\nLearning Talon¶\\n\\nThese are some resources to help you learn to use and customize Talon:\\n\\nTalon Practice (by chaosparrot)\\n\\nknausj_talon README\\n\\nUnofficial Community Wiki\\n\\nSearch User Repositories\\n\\n.talon Files¶\\n\\nOverview¶\\n\\nVoice commands are defined in files with the .talon file extension, located in the user directory inside Talon Home.\\n\\n.talon files can:\\n\\nmatch specific applications, window titles, or other criteria\\n\\ndefine voice commands\\n\\ndefine global hotkeys (Mac-only at the moment)\\n\\nreimplement global actions (for example, to change the behavior of Talon in a specific application)\\n\\nset settings\\n\\nenable tags\\n\\nCreating a file in user named hello.talon with these contents will declare a voice command:\\n\\nhello\\n\\ntalon\\n\\n\"hello world\"\\n\\nThis means when you say hello talon, Talon will type hello world.\\n\\nThis is a more advanced example:\\n\\n# activate this .talon file if the current app name is \"Chrome\"\\n\\n# you can find app names by running ui.apps() in the REPL\\n\\napp\\n\\nname\\n\\nChrome\\n\\n# key_wait increases the delay when pressing keys (milliseconds)\\n\\n# this is useful if an app seems to jumble or drop keys\\n\\nsettings\\n\\n():\\n\\nkey_wait\\n\\n4.0\\n\\n# activate the global tag \"browser\"\\n\\ntag\\n\\n():\\n\\nbrowser\\n\\n# define some voice commands\\n\\nhello\\n\\nchrome\\n\\n\"hello world\"\\n\\nswitch\\n\\ntab\\n\\nkey\\n\\nctrl\\n\\ntab\\n\\ngo\\n\\nto\\n\\ngoogle\\n\\n# note: use key(cmd-t) on Mac\\n\\nkey\\n\\nctrl\\n\\ninsert\\n\\n\"google.com\"\\n\\nkey\\n\\nenter\\n\\nThe -

git\\n\\nOpen a terminal\\n\\nPaste the following into the terminal and hit enter:\\ncd %AppData%\\\\Talon\\\\user\\ngit clone https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon knausj_talon\\n\\nNote that it is also possible to install knausj by downloading and extracting a zip file, but this approach is discouraged because it makes it more difficult to keep track of any changes you may make to your copy of the files.\\n\\nGetting started with Talon\\n\\nhelp active will display the available commands for the active application.\\n\\nAvailable commands can change with the application, or even window title that has focus.\\nYou may navigate help using the displayed numbers. e.g., help one one or help eleven to open the 11th item in the help list.\\nNote that all help-related commands are defined in core/help/help.talon and core/help/help_open.talon\\n\\nYou can also search for commands by saying help search <phrase>. For example, help search tab displays all tab-related commands, and help search help displays all help-related commands.\\n\\nYou can also jump immediately into a particular help context display by recalling the name displayed in help window (based on the name of the .talon file) e.g. help symbols or help visual studio\\n\\nhelp alphabet will display the alphabet\\n\\ncommand history will toggle a display of the recent commands\\n\\nhelp format will display the available formatters with examples.\\n\\nMany useful, basic commands are defined in https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/edit/standard.talon\\n\\nundo that and redo that are the default undo/redo commands.\\npaste that, copy that, and cut that for pasting/copy/cutting, respectively.\\n\\nFor community-generated documentation on Talon itself, please visit https://talon.wiki/\\n\\nIt\\'s recommended to learn the alphabet first, then get familiar with the keys, symbols, formatters, mouse, and generic_editor commands.\\n\\nOnce you have the basics of text input down, try copying some code from one window to another.\\n\\nAfter that, explore using ordinal repetition for easily repeating a command without pausing (e.g., saying go up fifth will go up five lines), window switching (focus chrome), and moving around in your text editor of choice.\\n\\nIf you use vim, just start with the numbers and alphabet, otherwise look at generic_editor.talon as well at jetbrains, vscode, and any other integrations.\\n\\nAlphabet\\n\\nThe alphabet is defined here\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/keys/keys.py#L3\\n\\nhelp alphabet will open a window that displays the alphabet. help close to hide the window.\\n\\nTry saying e.g. air bat cap to insert abc.\\n\\nKeys\\n\\nKeys are defined in keys.py. The alphabet is used for A-Z. For the rest, search for modifier_keys and then keep scrolling through the file, eg. roughly https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/keys/keys.py#L111\\n\\nAll key commands are defined in keys.talon. For example, say shift air to press shift-a, which types a capital A.\\n\\nOn Windows, try commands such as\\n\\ncontrol air to press control-a and select all.\\n\\nsuper-shift-sun to press windows-shift-s to trigger the screenshot application (Windows 10). Then try escape to exit the screenshot application.\\n\\nOn Mac, try commands such as\\n\\ncommand air to press command-a and select all.\\n\\ncontrol shift command 4 to press  ctrl-shift-cmd-4 to trigger the screenshot application. Then try escape to exit the screenshot application. Please note the order of the modifiers doesn\\'t matter.\\n\\nAny combination of the modifiers, symbols, alphabet, numbers and function keys can be executed via voice to execute shorcuts. Modifier keys can be tapped using press, for example press control to tap the control key by itself.\\n\\nSymbols\\n\\nSome symbols are defined in keys.py, so you can say e.g. control colon to press those keys.\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/keys/keys.py#L140\\n\\nSome other symbols are defined here: https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/plugin/symbols/symbols.talon\\n\\nFormatters\\n\\nhelp format will display the available formatters with examples of the output.\\n\\nTry using formatters by saying e.g. snake hello world, which will insert hello_world\\n\\nMultiple formatters can be used together, e.g. dubstring snake hello world. This will insert \"hello_world\"\\n\\nFormatters (snake, dubstring) are defined here\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/text/formatters.py#L137\\n\\nAll formatter-related commands are defined here\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/text/text.talon#L8\\n\\nMouse commands\\n\\nSee https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/plugin/mouse/mouse.talon\\n\\nGeneric editing commands\\n\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/edit/edit.talon\\n\\nThese generic commands are global. Commands such as go word left will work in any text box.\\n\\nRepeating commands\\n\\nFor repeating commands, useful voice commands are defined here: https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/plugin/repeater/repeater.talon\\n\\nTry saying e.g. go up fifth will go up five lines.\\nTry saying e.g. select up third to hit shift-up three times to select some lines in a text field.\\n\\nWindow management\\n\\nGlobal window managment commands are defined here:\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/windows_and_tabs/window_management.talon\\n\\nrunning list will toggle a GUI list of words you can say to switch to running applications.\\n\\nfocus chrome will focus the chrome application.\\n\\nlaunch music will launch the music application. Note this is currently only implemented on Mac OS X.\\n\\nScreenshot commands\\n\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/plugin/screenshot/screenshot.talon\\n\\nProgramming Languages\\n\\nSpecific programming languages may be activated by voice commands, or via title tracking.\\n\\nActivating languages via commands will enable the commands globally, e.g. they\\'ll work in any application. This will also disable the title tracking method (code.language in .talon files) until the \"clear language modes\" voice command is used.\\n\\nThe commands for enabling languages are defined here: https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/core/modes/language_modes.talon\\n\\nBy default, title tracking activates coding languages in supported applications such as VSCode, Visual Studio (requires plugin), and Notepad++.\\n\\nTo enable title tracking for your application:\\n\\nThe active filename (including extension) must be included in the editor\\'s title\\n\\nImplement the required Talon-defined filename action to correctly extract the filename from the programs\\'s title. See https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/apps/vscode/vscode.py#L122-L138 for an example.\\n\\nPython, C#, Talon and javascript language support is currently broken up into several tags in an attempt to define a common grammar where possible between languages. Each tag is defined by a .talon file, which defines the voice commands, and a Python file which declares the actions that should be implemented by each concrete language implementation to support those voice commands. Currently, the tags which are available are:\\n\\nlang/tags/comment_block.{talon,py} - block comments (e.g., C++\\'s /* */)\\n\\nlang/tags/comment_documentation.{talon,py} - documentation comments (e.g., Java\\'s /** */)\\n\\nlang/tags/comment_line.{talon,py} - line comments (e.g., Python\\'s #)\\n\\nlang/tags/data_null.{talon,py} - null & null checks (e.g., Python\\'s None)\\n\\nlang/tags/data_bool.{talon,py} - booleans (e.g., Haskell\\'s True)\\n\\nlang/tags/functions.{talon,py} - functions and definitions\\n\\nlang/tags/functions_common.{talon,py} - common functions (also includes a GUI for picking functions)\\n\\nlang/tags/imperative.{talon,py} - statements (e.g., if, while, switch)\\n\\nlang/tags/libraries.{talon,py} - libraries and imports\\n\\nlang/tags/libraries_gui.{talon,py} - graphical helper for common libraries\\n\\nlang/tags/object_oriented.{talon,py} - objects and classes (e.g., this)\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_array.{talon,py} - array operators (e.g., Ruby\\'s x[0])\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_assignment.{talon,py} - assignment operators (e.g., C++\\'s x += 5)\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_bitwise.{talon,py} - bitwise operators (e.g., C\\'s x >> 1)\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_lambda.{talon,py} - anonymous functions (e.g., JavaScript\\'s x => x + 1)\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_math.{talon,py} - numeric, comparison, and logical operators\\n\\nlang/tags/operators_pointer.{talon,py} - pointer operators (e.g., C\\'s &x)\\n\\nThe support for the language-specific implementations of actions are then located in:\\n\\nlang/{your-language}/{your-language}.py\\n\\nTo start support for a new language, ensure the appropriate extension is added to the language_extensions in language_modes.py.\\nThen create the following files:\\n\\nlang/{your-language}/{your-language}.py\\n\\nlang/{your-language}/{your-language}.talon\\n\\nActivate the appropriate tags in {your-language}.talon and implement the corresponding actions in {your-language}.py, following existing language implementations.\\nIf you wish to add additional voice commands for your language, put those in {your-language}.talon.\\nYou may also want to add a force command to language_modes.talon.\\n\\nFile Manager commands\\n\\nFor the following file manager commands to work, your file manager must display the full folder path in the title bar. https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/tags/file_manager/file_manager.talon\\n\\nFor Mac OS X\\'s Finder, run this command in terminal to display the full path in the title.\\n\\nFor Windows Explorer, follow these directions\\nhttps://www.howtogeek.com/121218/beginner-how-to-make-explorer-always-show-the-full-path-in-windows-8/\\n\\nFor the Windows command line, the refresh title command will force the title to the current directory, and all directory commands (follow 1) will automatically update the title.\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nâ€¢ Both Windows Explorer and Finder hide certain files and folder by default, so it\\'s often best to use the imgui to list the options before issuing commands.\\n\\nâ€¢ If there no hidden files or folders, and the items are displayed in alphabetical order, you can typically issue the follow <number>, file <number> and open <number> commands based on the displayed order.\\n\\nTo implement support for a new program, you need to implement the relevant file manager actions for your application and assert the user.file_manager tag.\\n\\nThere are a number of example implementations in the repository. Finder is a good example to copy and customize to your application as needed.\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/apps/finder/finder.py\\n\\nTerminal commands\\n\\nMany terminal programs are supported out of the box, but you may not want all the commands enabled.\\n\\nTo disable various commandsets in your terminal, find the relevant talon file and enable/disable the tags for command sets as appropriate.\\n\\nFor instance, kubectl commands (kubernetes) aren\\'t relevant to everyone.\\n\\nUnix utilities\\n\\nIf you have a Unix (e.g. OSX) or Linux computer, you can enable support for a number of\\ncommon terminal utilities like cat, tail, or grep by uncommenting the following\\nline in unix_shell.py:\\n\\nOnce you have uncommented the line, you can customize your utility commands by editing\\nsettings/unix_utilities.csv. Note: this directory is created when first running Talon\\nwith knausj_talon enabled.\\n\\nJetbrains commands\\n\\nFor Jetbrains commands to work you must install https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10504-voice-code-idea\\ninto each editor.\\n\\nSettings\\n\\nSeveral options are configurable via a single settings file out of the box. Any setting can be made context specific as needed (e.g., per-OS, per-app, etc).\\n\\nhttps://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon/blob/main/settings.talon\\n\\nThe most commonly adjusted settings are probably\\n\\nâ€¢ imgui.scale to improve the visibility of all imgui-based windows (help, history, etc). This is simply a scale factor, 1.3 = 130%.\\n\\nâ€¢ user.help_max_command_lines_per_page and user.help_max_contexts_per_page to ensure all help information is visible.\\n\\nâ€¢ user.mouse_wheel_down_amount and user.mouse_continuous_scroll_amount for adjusting the scroll amounts for the various scroll commands.\\n\\nAlso, you can add additional vocabulary words, words to replace, search engines and more. Complete the knausj_talon setup instructions above, then open the settings folder to see the provided CSV files and customize them as needed.\\n\\nOther talon user file sets\\n\\nIn addition to this repo, there are other Talon user file sets containing additional commands that you may want to experiment with if you\\'re feeling adventurous ðŸ˜Š. Many of them are meant to be used alongside knausj, but a few of them are designed as replacements. If it\\'s not clear which, please file an issue against the given GitHub repository for that user file set!\\n\\nCollaborators\\n\\nThis repository is now officially a team effort. The following contributors have direct access:\\n\\n@dwiel\\n\\n@fidgetingbits\\n\\n@knausj85\\n\\n@rntz\\n\\n@splondike\\n\\n@pokey\\n\\nCollaborators will reply to issues and pull requests as time and health permits. Please be patient.\\n\\nGuidelines for collaborators\\n\\nCollaborators prioritize their health and their personal/professional needs first. Their time commitment to this effort is limited.\\n\\nFor \"minor\" fixes and improvements/bugs/new apps, collaborators are free to contribute without any review\\n\\nFor \"significant\" new development and refactors, collaborators should seek appropriate input and reviews from each-other. Collaborators are encouraged to open a discussion before committing their time to any major effort.\\n\\nContributing\\n\\nSee CONTRIBUTING.md for our guidelines for contributors\\n\\nAutomatic formatting/linters\\n\\nThis repository uses pre-commit to run and manage its formatters/linters. Running these yourself is optional. If you wish to do so, first install pre-commit:\\n\\nYou then have a few options as to when to run it:\\n\\nRun yourself at any time on your locally changed files: pre-commit run\\n\\nRun yourself on all files in the repository: pre-commit run --all-files\\n\\nRun automatically on your PRs (fixes will be pushed automatically to your branch):\\n\\nVisit https://pre-commit.ci/ and authorize the app to connect to your knausj fork.\\n\\nSet up an editor hook to run on save:\\n\\nYou could follow the instructions for Black, which are well written; simply replace black <path> with pre-commit run --files <file>.\\nIt\\'s more performant to only reformat the specific file you\\'re editing, rather than all changed files.\\n\\nInstall a git pre-commit hook with pre-commit install (optional)\\n\\nThis essentially runs pre-commit run automatically before creating local commits, applying formatters/linters on all changed files. If it \"fails\", the commit will be blocked.\\nNote that because many of the rules automatically apply fixes, typically you just need to stage the changes that they made, then reattempt your commit.\\nWhether to use the hook comes down to personal taste. If you like to make many small incremental \"work\" commits developing a feature, it may be too much overhead.\\n\\nIf you run into setup difficulty with pre-commit, you might want to ensure that you have a modern Python 3 local environment first. pyenv is good way to install such Python versions without affecting your system Python (recommend installing 3.9 to match Talon\\'s current version). On macOS you can also brew install pre-commit.\\n\\nAutomated tests\\n\\nThere are a number of automated unit tests in the repository. These are all run outside of the Talon environment (e.g. we don\\'t have access to Talon\\'s window management APIs). These make use of a set of stubbed out Talon APIs in test/stubs/ and a bit of class loader trickery in conftest.py.\\n\\nTo run the test suite you just need to install the pytest python package in to a non-Talon Python runtime you want to use for tests (i.e. don\\'t install in the ~/.talon/.venv directory). You can then just run the pytest command from the repository root to execute all the tests.\\n\\nTalon documentation\\n\\nFor official documentation on Talon\\'s API and features, please visit https://talonvoice.com/docs/.\\n\\nFor community-generated documentation on Talon, please visit https://talon.wiki/\\n\\nAlternate installation method: Zip file\\n\\nIt is possible to install knausj by downloading and extracting a zip file instead of using git. Note that this approach is discouraged, because it makes it more difficult to keep track of any changes you may make to your copy of the files.\\n\\nIf you wish to install knausj_talon by downloading and extracting a zip file, proceed as follows:\\n\\nDownload the zip archive of knausj_talon\\n\\nExtract the files. If you donâ€™t know how to extract zip files, a quick google search for \"extract zip files\" may be helpful.\\n\\nPlace these extracted files inside the user folder of the Talon Home directory. You can find this folder by right clicking the Talon icon in taskbar, clicking Scripting > Open ~/talon, and navigating to user.\\n\\nAbout\\n\\nConfig for talon for Mac, Windows and Linux.

You can use it in .talon files directly, and most of the time don’t need to quote the argument. For example key(ctrl-f) is equivalent to key(\"ctrl-f\") in .talon files. In Python you do need to quote the argument and can use the action like this:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nactions\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\"ctrl-f\"\\n\\nHere’s some of the syntax you can use with the action:\\n\\nkey(\"f\") - Presses the f key.\\n\\nkey(\"ctrl-t\") - Presses and holds down the control key, then presses t, then releases everything.\\n\\nkey(\"\\\\\\\\\"\") - Presses the “ key.\\n\\nkey(\"ctrl-shift-alt-super-t\") - Presses and holds down the control, shift, alt (aka option on mac), and super (windows key or cmd key on mac) keys, then presses t, then releases everything. Note how you can apply multiple modifiers by connecting them with hyphens.\\n\\nkey(\"left delete\") - Presses the left arrow key, then the delete key.\\n\\nkey(\"ctrl:down\") - Presses and holds the control key. You can use “ctrl:up” to release the key later in the same or a a subsequent key() call. You can use :up and :down with any key, not just modifiers like control.\\n\\nkey(\"tab:3\") - Presses the tab key three times.\\n\\nSome key names are listed above, and some directly map to what is inserted (e.g. key(1) presses the number 1 key). Some key names are not obvious.

These docs are rendered and deployed to:\\n\\nhttps://talon.wiki/\\n\\nJoin the Talon Slack to find other folks interested in or using Talon. If you want to support the project, consider donating to the Patreon.\\n\\nWho can Contribute\\n\\nThis wiki belongs to the Talon Community, and contributions are welcome from anyone. Any member of the TalonCommunity GitHub organization can merge pull requests. Talon Community members can push directly to the main branch, which is the deployed branch.\\n\\nHow to Contribute\\n\\nContent is formatted using markdown syntax. There are multiple ways to contribute content:\\n\\nUsing Prose.io, a GitHub content editor\\n\\nLinks to edit content using Prose.io are embedded into the site in the top right corner:\\n\\nClicking these links should drop you into a content editor in your browser:\\n\\nThere’s a preview button to see your changes rendered in markdown:\\n\\nImages\\n\\nImages can be uploaded either by dragging and dropping the image into the prose editor or by clicking the image button in the markdown editor bar. These photos will be uploaded to the media directory and you should see some markdown generated for you:\\n\\nNew Pages\\n\\nProse by default suggests a filename with a date, and there isn’t a way currently to turn of this behavior. Please remove the date from the suggested filename, for example don’t use 2020-06-16-your-filename.md and instead name it without a date like your-filename.md. Remember to use the .md file extension. Files without the extension will not be rendered by jekyll.\\n\\nSaving Changes\\n\\nClick the save button, which will commit your changes. If you are a member of the Talon Community github organization, your changes will be committed directly to the deploy branch main and will show up https://talon.wiki once the site is rebuilt. If you are not a member of Talon Community, saving your changes will create a Pull Request on Github. Any member of Talon Community can merge the changes. Please ping someone on your pull request or find someone in the #talon-docs channels of the Talon Slack.\\n\\nUsing GitHub UI\\n\\nThere are links in the top right corner of the site to edit the content in GitHub. Clicking Add new, for example, will drop you into a GiHub UI for adding a new file:\\n\\nThe GitHub UI provides an option to either commit directly to main branch (if you are a member of Talon Community) or make a new branch and submit a pull request, which can be merged from a member of TalonCommunity.\\n\\nUsing git\\n\\nNew Pages\\n\\nNew pages can be added to the root directory - no need to add to any subfolder. Pages should include the .md file extension or they will not be rendered.\\n\\nImages\\n\\nAdd images to the media directory and include in markdown using the syntax:\\n\\nDeploying Changes\\n\\nAll changes merged to main branch will be automatically deployed using Netlify to the domain talon.wiki. There is some delay between merge and when site is refreshed with the new content, so expect changes to take a minute or two. If you are a member of TalonCommunity, you have write access and can merge your own changes.\\n\\nAdvanced\\n\\nIf you are only looking to add content to the wiki, you should not need to do any of the following setup. This is only relevant if you want to make changes to the wiki site itself or you want to preview locally instead of using prose or GitHub UI.\\n\\nHow this Wiki is Built\\n\\nThis wiki is built using:\\n\\njekyll, a static site generator\\n\\nNetlify, to host the site\\n\\ngit-wiki-theme, a wiki theme for jekyll\\n\\nprose.io, a content editor for GitHub\\n\\nThe theme is built directly into the repository so we could patch any changes as needed.\\n\\nMaking Custom Style Changes\\n\\nThis wiki is built using a custom theme, but it is possible to override any of the style in overrides/css/custom.css.\\n\\nPreviewing Changes Locally\\n\\nFollow the instructions in the Quickstart jekyll docs to setup a Ruby environment and install bundler.  To build the site and make it available to a local server, run:\\n\\nand open http://localhost:4000 in a browser.\\n\\nSome functionality, such as the editing with prose, cannot be easily tested locally.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/CONTRIBUTING/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nWhat can I say?\\n\\nHow can I code in different languages with Talon\\n\\nWhat hardware should I have?\\n\\nAre languages other than English supported?\\n\\nHow can I make talon recognise me better?\\n\\nHow can I contribute?\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nWhat can I say?\\n\\nCheckout the common commands to get started using Talon.\\n\\nHow can I code in different languages with Talon\\n\\nTalon does not require special configuration for different programming languages, but many users have per-language customizations to improve efficiency. Checkout the section on Programming Languages in the knausj Talon user file set README for more information on how to use different language modes included in knausj.\\n\\nWhat hardware should I have?\\n\\nCheck out the hardware page for microphone and eye tracker recommendations.\\n\\nAre languages other than English supported?\\n\\nThey’re being worked on, join Talon Slack and find a channel for your language to see how it’s going. If you are in the beta program, you can configure the WebSpeech API for dictation in other languages.\\n\\nHow can I make talon recognise me better?\\n\\nSee the page Improving Recognition Accuracy.\\n\\nHow can I contribute?\\n\\nWhile Talon is closed source, there’s plenty you can do to help:\\n\\nhttps://speech.talonvoice.com/ Extend the voice data set used for speech recognition training.\\n\\nPublish your talon commands on Github for others to use like https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon. You can search every fork of knausj using this search engine.\\n\\nReport issues at https://github.com/talonvoice/talon/issues\\n\\nAdd more to these docs :)\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nCheckout the troubleshooting for solutions to common problems.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/FAQ/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nRunning Mac or Linux Talon Using Windows Dragon\\n\\nThis document is out of date and may be incorrect in parts.

However, your copy of Dragon on your windiws machine understands your commands and dictation better.  You can link your two computers so that you can use the windows machine with Dragon as the voice engine that processes all your voice commands in the background and turns them into text strings, which will be sent back to Talon on your linux or mac and used to command and control your favorite OS by voice. Here’s how:\\n\\nRunning Linux or Mac Talon against Windows Dragon:  This allows you to use a copy of Windows Dragon on a windows OS as your voice engine.\\n\\nFind the latest “Released” message in #beta.

This page aims to be a pragmatic guide for performing some common modifications and is aimed at a beginner audience, including non-programmers. A more complete treatment of Talon’s capabilities can be found in the unofficial Talon docs.\\n\\nThis page assumes that Talon is responding to your voice and you are using the knausj_talon Talon user file set.\\n\\nIf you are having trouble with anything here or in Talon more generally, the best way to get help is on the Talon Slack.\\n\\nCustomization overview\\n\\nAll customization consists of files with .talon or .py file extensions placed in the Talon user directory. The Talon user directory is where you put the knausj_talon Talon user file set (“~/.talon/user/” on MacOS/Linux, “%APPDATA%\\\\Talon\\\\user” on Windows). Talon doesn’t care how you organize your files within this directory, any subdirectories or file names are just there to make things easier to understand for you and others.\\n\\nPython programming language (one of the most popular programming languages in the world).\\n\\nunofficial talon docs.\\n\\nManaging your customizations\\n\\nTalon is built to be a flexible and customizable system. This means that in addition to being able to add new voice commands you can also override the behavior of existing commands reasonably easily.\\n\\nGiven this flexibility there are two ways you could approach customizing your Talon setup:\\n\\nOption A: Edit the .talon and .py files within the knausj_talon directory.\\n\\nOption B: Maintain your own separate directory with your customizations.\\n\\nOption A can be easier to begin with, but makes it somewhat harder to keep your knausj_talon up to date. This is because you need to work out what you modified and how to re-apply it to the knausj Talon user file set every time you update it. We recommend using Option B with separate directories as much as possible, only resorting to direct editing when you have to.\\n\\nThe screenshot below shows my Talon user directory. You can see that I have a knausj_talon folder in the same way that you would. The rest of the folders are other ‘Talon user file sets’ I’m using. All my personal customizations are in the ‘mystuff’ folder; knausj_talon is completely unchanged from what I downloaded from github.\\n\\nLet’s speak about versioning your configuration for a minute. You will probably want to update your knausj_talon Talon user file set occasionally in order to pick up new features and bug fixes. Unfortunately changing knausj_talon may also sometimes add new bugs! If this happens you might want to go back the older version so you can keep working. If you’re confident with the git program this is straightforward. If you’re not, then just making a backup of the whole Talon user directory prior to making a potentially significant change doesn’t hurt.\\n\\nWith that out of the way we’re going to work through a simple .talon file example to give you an idea of how to create them.\\n\\nA simple .talon file\\n\\nLet’s make a new voice command that presses the key combination cmd+a or control+a when you say “select everything”. This will work in a similar way to the ‘select all’ command built in to knausj_talon.\\n\\nFirst let’s get you an appropriate plain text editor. We’re looking for something like Notepad in windows that just saves unformatted text files (so not Libreoffice or Microsoft Word). We can do much better than Notepad however. A simple editor which you can use on Windows, MacOS, or Linux is Geany.\\n\\nOpen up your editor and save an empty file called simple_test.talon somewhere in your Talon user directory. Next, right click on the Talon icon in your status bar, choose scripting, and then ‘View log’. This will show a list of log messages from Talon, and in particular will be where Talon tells us if there’s a problem with what we write in simple_test.talon.\\n\\nOK, let’s get to defining the command. If you’re running MacOS, copy/paste the following into your editor and save the file (ensure you have the spaces at the start of the ‘key’ line):\\n\\nIf you’re on Windows or Linux you can use this instead:\\n\\nYou should see a line like 2021-09-02 17:33:36 DEBUG [+] /home/normal/.talon/user/mystuff/simple_test.talon printed in your Talon log. This indicates that Talon has picked up your new/updated file and has loaded it. In general Talon will automatically pick up and apply any changes to .talon or .py files in your Talon user directory, so you don’t have to restart Talon each time you make a change. If you don’t see a line like that and can’t figure it out, then you might want to ask for help on the Talon slack in the #help channel.\\n\\nYour command should now be defined, so if you focus your text editor and say “select everything” it should indeed select everything.\\n\\nError messages\\n\\nOK, let’s now deliberately introduce an error so we can see how Talon tells us about that. Edit your file and remove the final ‘)’ character so the last line is “  key(cmd-a” or “  key(ctrl-a”. Save the file and look at your Talon log. For me, Talon writes out the following:\\n\\nSo that’s quite a lot of output. The useful bit is at the bottom:\\n\\nYou can see it has the “in script at /home/normal/.talon/user/simple_test.talon:2:” line. This tells us the file the problem occurred in, and also the (maybe approximate) line number the problem was on, ‘2’ in our case. There is also some suggestive text indicating that Talon was expecting a ‘)’ character. The error message you get will depend on the problem with what you’ve written, but it should always tell you which file has the problem in it, and also the approximate line the problem was on.\\n\\nOK, we’re finished with this file now so you can delete it.\\n\\n.talon file syntax\\n\\nTalon files look something like this:\\n\\nThe part above the ‘-‘ line is called the “context header” and the part below is the “body”. The context header decides under what circumstances the rest of the file will be active. The body defines voice commands and other behaviour.\\n\\nContext header\\n\\nThe context header defines when the rest of the file will be active.\\n\\nIn this example our context header says that the file is only active when the word ‘Gmail’ is in the window title. The context header is optional; if it is not included (as in our simple_test.talon example) then the file is always active.\\n\\nBody\\n\\nThe body can have several kinds of content. Most often you’ll be defining voice commands, so that’s all we’ll talk about here.\\n\\nVoice commands start with the actual words you want to speak followed by a ‘:’ character. They then list out all the actions you want to perform as a result of that command. If you only want to perform a single action then you can put it on a single line as in the first ‘find on page’ command. If you have more than one action you must put each action on its own line. The actions associated with a command must be indented with spaces, but it doesn’t matter how many you use. Separate voice commands with one or more blank lines.\\n\\nA more complete guide to .talon files is included in the unofficial docs.\\n\\nActions in .talon files\\n\\nYou might have noticed that we’ve been using the key() and insert() actions in the example files so far. There are a number of built in actions, and extra actions can be defined in .py files. To get a complete list of defined actions you can do the following:\\n\\nRight click on the Talon icon in your status bar, choose scripting, and then ‘Console (REPL)’. This will open a terminal window where you type Python commands and the result of those commands are printed out.\\n\\nType actions.list() and press enter. This will list out all the available actions.\\n\\nYou might like to look at this list of actions in your text editor (so you can search them, for example). To put the full list into your clipboard, copy and paste this code into the terminal window and press enter:\\n\\nSome of the more useful actions are:\\n\\nkey(ctrl-a) - Presses the keys within the parentheses. See the ‘Add new keyboard shortcuts’ recipe below for some more info about using this action.\\n\\ninsert(\"my text\") - Types in the text “my text”\\n\\nsleep(100ms) - Waits for 100 milliseconds. This can be useful if you need to wait for your target application to do something. Don’t make the sleep too long because Talon will not respond to voice commands while sleeping.\\n\\nmouse_move(100, 200) - Moves the mouse to screen coordinates 100 pixels from the left and 200 from the top.\\n\\nmouse_scroll(0, -10) - Scrolls the mouse 10 ‘units’ to the left. mouse_scroll(10) would scroll the mouse 10 ‘units’ down. Note that the arguments are y, x rather than x, y.\\n\\nmouse_click(0) - Clicks the left mouse button at the cursor. mouse_click(1) right clicks.\\n\\nRecipes\\n\\nIf you’ve read the above you should have some idea of how to make customizations to Talon, particularly using .talon files. This section contains a recipe list of some common/instructive customizations you might like to make. The list isn’t intended to be complete of course, we’re trying to strike a balance between page length and usefulness.\\n\\nAs always, see the unofficial docs page for a much more complete understanding and for more advanced/powerful concepts.\\n\\nAdd new keyboard shortcuts\\n\\nOften you will want to add a new voice command to press an application specific keyboard shortcut. Let’s choose the YouTube webpage as our example. The following .talon file defines two new voice commands:\\n\\nThese commands only apply when the window title has “YouTube” in it. “search cats” first presses the “/” key to focus the YouTube search box, then waits 100 milliseconds to make sure it has been focussed, then types in “cats” and presses enter.\\n\\nKeyboard shortcuts will almost always make use of the key() action. For more information on how to use that see the key() action page.\\n\\nSlow down key presses\\n\\nA reasonably common problem that comes up when using Talon with computer games is that the application only recognizes key presses intermittently or not at all. This can be because Talon presses and releases the keys too quickly. The following .talon file makes Talon hold down each key for 32 milliseconds before releasing it. You could try increasing the key_hold value incrementally to find the smallest length of time you need to hold for the key to be recognized reliably:\\n\\nNote the use of app.exe as the context matcher to match the filename of the active program. See the unofficial docs for a full list of available matchers.\\n\\nSettings\\n\\nkey_hold isn’t the only or necessarily the best setting for your keyboard issue. There are also many other settings for configuring other aspects of Talon’s behaviour.\\n\\nsettings() blocks can be put in any .talon file and are used to change the value of settings given a matching context header. You can have multiple settings by putting each on its own indented line underneath the “settings():” line. You can include voice commands in the same file as a settings block.\\n\\nYou can paste the following code into the REPL to see a full list of available settings: settings.list(). A list of some of the more useful ones are included here. knausj_talon also has a list of some extra settings it defines in the settings.talon file.\\n\\nKeyboard shortcuts\\n\\nYou have the ability to set keyboard shortcuts in .talon files. The following .talon file toggles whether Talon is listening to speech when you press the ctrl + t key combination:\\n\\nThe shortcut is global since there’s no context matcher in this .talon file restricting it to a particular application for example. You could replace speech.toggle() with the same types of things that you would use in a voice command.\\n\\nOverriding existing voice commands\\n\\nOne thing that may not be immediately obvious is that re-using voice commands is perfectly acceptable. You can just create a new .talon file with a new context header and redefine the command.\\n\\nThis also provides a simple way of overriding the behaviour of existing voice commands from the knausj_talon Talon user file set. Lets say you wanted to change the behaviour of the touch command so that it didn’t hide the mouse grid if it was open.\\n\\nThe existing code is in a .talon file without a context header called mouse.talon:\\n\\nWe can see the user.grid_close() action is called to close the grid after clicking the mouse. Also note the lines starting with ‘#’ characters are called comments. They are just there for documentation and will not be otherwise processed by Talon.\\n\\nIf we wanted to stop the user.grid_close() behaviour we could just create a new .talon file and put in the following contents:\\n\\nNotice that we’ve given it a context header. Because this context headar is more specific (i.e. it has more rules in it) this implementation of “touch” will take precedence over the original. The implementation just has the user.grid_close() line and associated comment removed.\\n\\nIn general you can use this technique by just making a version of the .talon file you want to override and putting in more redundant rules to make it the more specific version. In addition to “os: “ some other redundant filters you can add are “mode: command” (assuming you want to define the command in the default ‘command’ mode) and “speech.engine: wav2letter” (assuming you’re not using Dragon).\\n\\nThis is a simple way of overriding voice commands using .talon files. Many other parts of the system (such as the behaviour of actions) can also be overridden, but this requires editing .py files. See the unofficial docs for more information.\\n\\nTurn off Talon listening on start up\\n\\nIf you’d prefer not to you have Talon enabled when you start the app (and typically your computer), create a python filed in your user directory (e.g. sleep.py) and put in the following contents:\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/basic_customization/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n    \\n      Command history\\n      Show available comands\\n      Switch between modes\\n      Open and switch between windows in apps such as Chrome\\n      Working with applications\\n      Working with tabs\\n      Working with media\\n      Working with the Tobii eye tracker\\n      Working with text\\n      Working with the mouse and scrolling\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nThe examples below are just a very small selection of common commands for working with apps, tabs, media, mouse, etc that should help you be productive with Talon right away.

The rest of this page provides some additional information to supplement the information provided there.\\n\\nRun the Talon app.\\n\\nNotes on Linux installation:\\nIf you use Gnome, you need to install AppIndicator and KStatusNotifierItem Support in order to be able to see Talon’s tray icon - which is the only way of configuring it without speech/code.\\n\\nIf you use Wayland, you might encounter the following error:\\n\\nIn which case it is necessary to switch to Xorg. (Your distribution might support this through a cog wheel on the login screen.)\\n\\nConfigure a Speech Recognition Engine\\n\\nTalon uses a speech recognition engine that translates voice audio to text. To install your speech engine, open the Talon menu and select Speech Recognition -> Conformer.\\n\\nNote: The Conformer speech engine is recommended, but it is possible to use Talon with other speech engines, for example, if you already use Dragon or need an engine with support additional languages other than English. For information about additional speech engines, see the speech engine page.\\n\\nInstall a Talon user file set\\n\\nTalon does not come with voice commands out of the box - you must install some additional files. To start out, we strongly recommend that you use the knausj_talon Talon user file set. The whole wiki assumes this repository is used, if not otherwise noted.\\n\\nSee knausj_talon for installation instructions.\\n\\nIn addition to knausj_talon, you may want to consider installing:\\n\\nCursorless for programming and text editing\\n\\nRango for browser navigation\\n\\ngaze-ocr for advanced cursor control using eye tracking and text recognition (OCR)\\n\\nAXKit (macOS only) to enhance Talon with native OS accessibility integrations\\n\\nOther user file sets\\n\\nTest your Talon Setup\\n\\nTest your Talon setup with a few basic commands.\\n\\nJoin the Talon Slack\\n\\nIf at any point you need help with your Talon setup, join the Talon Voice Slack and ask in the #help channel.\\n\\nNext Steps\\n\\nOnce the basics somewhat work for you, you’ll likely want to improve your experience using Talon:\\n\\nFor users who want earlier access to new features, priority support, and access to additional speech engines, install the beta version.\\n\\nImprove Recognition Accuracy: Better accuracy never hurts.

Compared to webcams and cheap headsets, a good microphone for speech recognition picks up less background noise (improving your experience whenever you’re not alone in a silent room) and will be better at recording a natural-sounding voice.\\n\\nModel Recommendations\\n\\nThese are models that Talon community members regularly recommend:\\n\\nBlue Yeti Nano (USB 3): desktop, affordable and pretty good recognition. Can be attached to an arm. Useful if you’re trying out speech recognition for the first time and don’t want to spend a lot.\\n\\nSamson Q9u: a step up from the Blue Yeti, but still affodable desktop mic that can be operated as either USB and XLR.\\n\\nDPA d:fine 4188 or 4288: expensive, but highly recommended for full time use.  It’s likely the best in wearing comfort, audio quality and voice isolation (see this impressive demo from the manufacturer). The DPA mic can be paired with either (i) a Shure X2U + microdot to XLR adapter or (ii) a DPA d:vice interface. (i) will be cheaper, but a bit less portable, than the latter; (i) does however have a live monitor (you can plug in headphones and hear the computer audio mixed with your voice), whereas (ii) doesn’t.\\n\\nAudio-Technica BP894: a much more budget-friendly alternative to the DPA microcapsule microphones above, but still excellent comfort, quality, and voice isolation. This model has been discontinued in favor of the BP894x so there are some great deals to be had ($100-300 (depending if you want to make it wireless). Check out #BP894_fan_club on Slack for tips on picking the right termination and adapter for your needs.\\n\\nStenomask: useful for open plan offices as it covers your mouth.\\n\\nXLR Microphones and USB XLR Audio interfaces as a budget-minded alternative to the DPA combo:\\n\\nAKG C 520 (or the C 520L plus the AKG MPA VL Male adapter); compared to the DPA you have to give up significant amount of voice isolation and some wearing comfort and audio quality (a demo from a singing drummer).\\n\\nAudio-Technica Pro 8 HEx; a long-standing recommendation from 2shea’s intro post; even cheaper still, you lose some more audio quality again, but it is perfectly suitable for use with Talon.\\n\\nSuitable audio interfaces are for instance Shure X2U (rather compact), Focusrite Scarlett Solo (very popular) or the Behringer U-Phoria UMC22 (a great budget option).\\n\\nThere are a ton of other brands and models, and many will work just fine.\\n\\nPlug-In powered mics\\n\\nThe Speechrecsolutions selection guide lists options at several price-points.  We don’t know about each and every model, but you can ask on #hardware for some experience report.\\n\\nBOYA BY-M1: cheap ~$15 clip-on lavalier mic useful for getting comfortable with Talon. Much better speech recognition and latency than most bluetooth headphones and webcam mics. Only useable if you’re the only speaker in the room, though it does cope well with non-speech background noise (e.g. fans, washing machines). May need an adapter if your device has separate input/output connectors.\\n\\nCan this mic maybe work?\\n\\nMany microphones used by studio professionals and ambitious podcasters will likely work well, but gaming and call-center headsets can be hit or miss.  But beware: While technical specs may suggest issues, on their own they cannot guarantee success!  Generally speaking:\\n\\nThe mic should have a good frequency response over at least 150 Hz to 16 kHz.\\n\\nAn omnidirectional microphone will be acceptable in a room without competing voices (other people or media playback).  In other cases, you will likely need a microphone with good background rejection (a cardioid polar pattern is helpful, but not every cardioid mic is the same).\\n\\nIt should sound good.  If you can, listen to samples.  If it sounds bad or muffled or metallic or anything unnatural to you, avoid it.  (The online store Thomann provides samples for many mics.)\\n\\nA USB connection is strongly recommended over Bluetooth. Bluetooth introduces compression artifacts and latency. Compression reduces the recognition accuracy, and latency will make your computer slow to react.  BT AptX LowLatency is reported by some to work, but usually requires a separate dongle.\\n\\nSome people do report success with much cheaper microphones, but many also do not.  If you already have one, just try it out, but if not, think twice before buying cheap.\\n\\nWindows & Bluetooth Headsets\\n\\nWindows default drivers have a limitation and that they cannot record and play stereo sound simultaneously. See this stackoverflow answer for more details. For this reason, if you want to hear audio while dictating, you must use a wired (or plug in your) headset on Windows. OSX does not have this limitation.\\n\\nEye Trackers\\n\\nCheck out the #eye-tracking channel in Slack, and the Tobii 4c Tips page.\\n\\nTobii 4C is a commonly used and recommended eye tracker, but it is slowly being superceded as the default as more folks are starting to use the Tobii 5. Talon also supports the Tobii PCEye Mini. Support for most 4th gen Tobii devices can be trivially added.\\n\\nTobii 5 is the newer model and may be easier to find than the 4C. This one does require a one-time initialization on a Windows PC with the Tobii software installed. Check out the dedicated Tobii 5 page.\\n\\nFoot Pedals\\n\\nFoot pedals provide another alternative input method, though they often require intensive customization. The use cases for foot pedals varies and can be unique to a specific workflow, but there are few that are more common: scrolling, muting, and mouse replacement.\\n\\nThe customization for foot pedals is more involved than editing Talon files, and it helps to be familiar with the ctx python api especially for more complex use cases. There are some limitations as well. For example, the foot pedal needs to bind to a key that is not otherwise being used, e.g., some users have used keypad_divide, keypad_multiply, or keypad_minus. Also, some actions don’t work well with Talon hotkeys, and user.vscode Knausj commands have timeout issues if read asynchronously. To bind pressing two pedals at once, some users have needed to use cron and asyncronous reading of a state dictionary.\\n\\nOlympus RS31H is used by a few Talon Community members. It has 4 buttons (whereas other options only have 3).

Many people even have to tweak something to get a good experience.  Here we show you what you can do.\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nA quiet room will always be better than a noisy one.  A good microphone can mitigate this, but sometimes a $0 job will do.  Move fans and air filters, rotate your sitting position such that air conditioning is not pointing toward the mic, close a door (and subsitute by taking more breaks for health and ventilation).  Move your PC from above desk to below desk, move your PC speakers behind your mic, etc.\\n\\nMicrophone\\n\\nMake sure that you have a good microphone and sound card, as speech recognition software requires better hardware than is commonly built in to computers. Have a look at the hardware page for recommendations and correct setup.\\n\\nKeep a relaxed voice\\n\\nEnsure that your voice is not tired, which will lead to poorer pronunciation.\\n\\nDrink some warm beverages throughout the day: warm water and tea are especially helpful.\\n\\nTry to speak in a natural tone as if you are talking with someone else.  At first this will feel a little weird, but speaking in an unatural voice will tire you out quicker.\\n\\nTry to keep your speaking volume consistent and low, quality microphones can easily pick up any volume you talk at.  Speaking with low volume should help keep you from getting tired out.  You may need to increase the mic gain for optimal results.\\n\\nPronounciation, and/or (non-native) accents\\n\\nControlling your computer by voice can be frustrating if your accent isn’t recognized well; non-native speakers are especially prone to issues.  While Talon’s engine is improving with each version, in the meantime we can adapt our pronunciation.\\n\\nhttps://rachelsenglish.com/ is an excellent resource. It features detailed videos and discussion of the mechanics behind the various sounds. At the risk of saying the obvious: you shouldn’t try to change your accent if you don’t want to.\\n\\nSome commands are barely ever recognized, or confused for another command\\n\\nIf only a few specific commands give you trouble, change those command words!  Commands are almost exclusively mapped in .talon files: search for all occurrences of those words, and replace them with a word of your choosing: select one that is easy to pronounce, is not too similar to anything else, and is recognized well for you.\\n\\nSome important commands are specified in .py files, like the alphabet.  Changing it works the same way, but you need to be more careful about what you modify.  If you are not a programmer, ask in the Talon Slack #help channel if you are unsure!\\n\\nTalon cuts me off mid-command or mid-sentence\\n\\nTalon lets you configure how long it will wait after you stop speaking before trying to interpret your command. As of March 2021, the default is 0.3 seconds; earlier versions had a default of 0.15 seconds. If you find that Talon is frequently cutting you off mid-command, you may want to try one or more of the following:\\n\\nPrepare your command in full before voicing it.  This will help you speak fluently.\\n\\nSpeak faster, especially after consonants like “p” that involve stopping airflow. In utterances like “stop it”, there is a natural pause between “stop” and “it”.  Some people have just slightly longer stops than others, but can avoid it when preparing to talk fluently.\\n\\nIncrease Talon’s wait time. This has the disadvantage of making all commands react slower, but it can eliminate the cutoffs. Do this by adding a settings.talon file to your user directory with the following content:\\n    settings():\\n    # minimum silence time (in seconds) before speech is cut off, default 0.3\\n    speech.timeout = 0.4\\n    \\n    Start with the value of 0.4, just slightly higher than the default, and increase only if necessary.\\n\\nHelp improving the Talon recognition engine\\n\\nThis will not help you today, but instead help to improve the talon engine for all of us in the future.  You can do this by providing speech (and noise) samples:\\n\\nTalon Speech Collection\\n\\nTalon Noise Collection\\n\\nCollected alternatives to the default alphabet\\n\\nSpeakers of non-rhotic dialectics of English (i.e. your ‘r’s don’t sound like an American’s) may find it helpful to change the alphabet.

The Conformer speech engine is recommended, but it is possible to use Talon with other speech engines, for example, if you already use Dragon and want to use Talon with Dragon or need a speech engine with language support other than English.\\n\\nW2L Conformer\\n\\nWin/Mac/Linux\\n\\nBest option for new users. Excellent accuracy and speed for both commands and dictation. Even lower latency for Talon beta users due to ongoing performance optimisations.\\n\\nTalon Docs\\n\\nFree\\n\\nW2L Gen2\\n\\nWin/Mac/Linux\\n\\nSpeech engine used prior to Conformer. Decent command accuracy. Dictation accuracy is lacking.\\n\\nTalon Docs\\n\\nFree\\n\\nDragon\\n\\nWin\\n\\nGood accuracy for both commands and dictation. Has quirks which can’t be fixed by us. Professional version is recommended over home version (home version doesn’t have command mode).\\n\\nBuy and Install Dragon Professional\\n\\n$300-$500\\n\\nNote: The Professional version of Dragon for Windows is recommended (but not strictly required) because it can be run in Command Mode. Some users have been able to find less expensive copies of Dragon by either waiting for a sale or looking on eBay for older versions.\\n\\nDictation Engines for Additional Language Support\\n\\nAs of March 2021, W2L only supports English. If you need to dictate text in another language, the Talon beta supports the following options:\\n\\nwebspeech\\n\\nWin/Mac/Linux\\n\\nExcellent accuracy, but added latency. Uses your browser as a voice engine; requires an internet connection.

These range from ‘base’ user file sets that contain their whole Talon setup through to sets which build on top of knausj_talon functionality.\\n\\nIf intended for public consumption, these Talon user file sets are mostly annouced via the Slack channel. Aside from that there are a few ways you can discover them:\\n\\nYou can make use of the talon code search. This aims to search all known github repositories containing Talon related code. If you’re looking for integration with a particular application this is a good option.\\n\\nYou can browse the github talonvoice topic. Repositories can optionally tag themselves with this to aid discoverability.\\n\\nYou can take a look at the manually curated list below.\\n\\nVoice controlled hands free mouse replacements\\n\\nThe easiest way to control your mouse with Talon is to use an eye tracker. But this is fairly expensive hardware. There are several voice/noise only options in addition to the ‘mouse grid’ built in to knausj_talon.\\n\\ngaze-ocr for advanced cursor control using eye tracking and text recognition (OCR)\\n\\nDense Mouse Grid Less obtrusive overlay combining a letter and number grid to position the mouse.\\n\\nFlex Mouse Grid Flex Mouse Grid extends the functionality of Dense Mouse Grid.\\n\\nAlphabet Soup Mouse  This mouse overlays a very dense grid of letters onto the screen for very precise mouse placement. Created by Aegis, TimoTimo, and TaraRoys.\\n\\ncrosshairs mouse guide mouse Created by Aegis.  Allows you to say very specific mouse coordinates and position the mouse precisely on the screen.\\n\\nRacecar Mouse (AKA drawing mouse) A mouse you can use to draw with Talon. It steers like a racecar around the screen. Created by Timotimo.\\n\\nHissing Mouse Created by Tara Roys. A mouse that operates soley by hissing, and uses the idea that if you make a left turn you can get anywhere on the screen by ‘circling the block.’  Simplest possible no-words, no-hands, no need to memorize commands mouse.\\n\\nProgramming and editor integrations\\n\\nCursorless Structural code editing in VSCode. This with knausj_talon is the state of the art for voice coding with Talon currently.\\n\\nFidgetingbit’s knausj fork Fork of knausj_talon most famous for its integration with the (N)Vim code editor.\\n\\nUser Interface\\n\\nTalon Heads Up Display This heads up display is awesome because it shows things like when Talon is awake, asleep, what language mode active, prints a pretty history, And a whole bunch of other things that right now you have to memorize.\\n\\nTalon Deck Stream deck inspired interactive dashboard for Talon.

Lets you play chess on Lichess.org for example.\\n\\nRango Allows you to easily click active elements in the browser using your voice. An alternative to Vimium with better Talon integration.\\n\\nCommand builders and macros\\n\\nTalon user sets that allow you to build voice commands more easily or define commands in a quick ad-hoc way. knausj_talon has an ephemeral macro system built in, but these user file sets extend that further.\\n\\nTalon UI helper Command wizard that lets you build TalonScript commands which work with the screen as an image. For example it lets you easily build a command to click an icon, or show an overlay for clicking items in a list.\\n\\nScreen spots Lets you quickly save mouse positions on the screen and then click them with a short voice command. Useful for games with fixed UI element position.\\n\\nClipboard helpers\\n\\nMultidimensional clipboard Lets you store and retrieve multiple text snippets from a Talon maintained clipboard.\\n\\nIndexed clipboard Lets you store and retrieve multiple text snippets from a Talon maintained clipboard.\\n\\nOther\\n\\nAXKit (macOS only) to enhance Talon with native OS accessibility integrations\\n\\nknausj’s clickless mouse Use the mouse for positioning, but hover an overlay to click.\\n\\nSubtitles.md  A basic script for writing subtitles to a file for a screencapture.\\n\\nTalon Cheatsheet Generation Script How to generate a cheatsheet for your own repository\\n\\nwenkokke’s cheatsheet and generation script Another cheatsheet generator which can output HTML or PDF.\\n\\nMorse Keypresses allows you to spell out letters using morse code and the hissing noise.\\n\\nWindow Tweak A Talon module for moving and resizing windows using voice commands.\\n\\nTalon WM Basic tiling window manager implementation in Talon.\\n\\nSoftware that pairs well with Talon Not a Talon user file set per-se, but other things you might find useful.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/talon_user_file_sets/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nTobii 4c Eye Tracker Tips and Tricks\\n    \\n      Notes on Control Mouse\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nTobii 4c Eye Tracker Tips and Tricks\\n\\nIf you glance down at Tobii 4c, you should be able to clearly see all the visible red lights:  left, center, and right. If you can’t, the Tobii can’t see you very well either!\\n\\nIt can be somewhat useful to temporarily load the official Tobii software on Windows, if that’s an option for you. The Tobii software can give you a good feel for proper positioning with the Tobii 4c.\\n\\nDistance is a very important factor when using the Tobii 4c. It’s difficult to know the “optimal” distance, so the best advice is simply to experiment with different distances.\\n\\nBe sure to recalibrate after significantly adjusting your position, adjusting the Tobii’s position, or if the tracking feels more inaccurate than usual\\n\\nLighting matters quite a bit. The Tobii 4c works better in a lit room. You also don’t want e.g. sunlight directly beating down on the device\\n\\nSome folks feel the largest useable monitor is 24”, though Tobii claims 27”.\\n\\nTry both the “control mouse” and “zoom mouse” modes out to see which works best for you. Demo here\\n\\nFor the zoom mouse, tinker with the zoom level of zoom mouse for comfort & less scanning. See an example of how to adjust these here\\n\\nCheck the Talon Voice logs for errors:\\n    \\n      “talon.track.tobii.EyeCmdErr: Eye Tracker command 0x42e raised error 0x20000502” means Talon Voice cant determine the location of your head or gaze.  It could be a problem with tracker position, head position, monitor size, or multiple screens (dont use extended or mirrored screens with Talon).\\n\\nCalibrate your eye tracker in Talon if you change monitors or if your room lighting changes substantially.\\n\\nNotes on Control Mouse\\n\\nThe intended use is that you look at the thing you want to click on, then move your head (rotate, tilt, whatever) to put the mouse cursor over the thing, then use some method of clicking (like a voice command or physical button).\\n\\nMoving your head is an important part of the new Control Mouse - moving your head locks your cursor to the current region until you look to a new part of the screen. This means the cursor will stabilize more when you start moving your head.\\n\\nThe speed at which you move your head has an exponential effect on the speed the mouse moves, so if you move your head very slowly, the mouse will only move a few pixels, but if you move your head very quickly, you can move the mouse by several inches.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/tobii_4c_tips/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nTobii 5 Eye Tracker\\n    \\n      Setup\\n      Next steps\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nTobii 5 Eye Tracker\\n\\nSetup\\n\\nRegardless of which OS you will be using when you use your eye tracker, the initial setup requres that the eye tracker be connected to a Windows machine with internet access to complete the setup installation. After the initial setup, the eye tracker can be used on Windows, Mac, or Linux.\\n\\nConnect your new Tobii 5c eye tracker via USB to a Windows computer with an internet connection.\\n\\nWndows should bring up the “Tobii Experience” configuration software automatically. This software should recognize your Tobii 5 hardware and prompt you to start a setup process. You don’t actually need to do this.\\n\\nIf you are using Mac or Linux: Disconnect the tracker from the Windows machine and connect to your Mac or Linux machine.\\n\\nIf you are using Linux: When first running run.sh, Talon does some setup work related to permissions for the eye tracking device. You need to replug the eye tracking device and restart Talon (or of course reboot).\\n\\nIf you are using Windows: Tobii runs three services by default that you will need to disable. Find the Services app by typing “services” in the start menu. Next scroll down until you find the three services that start with the word ‘Tobii’. For each of these right click to view Properties and then change “Startup type” to “Disabled”. Then either disable each of the services manually or restart your computer. If you’d want to use the Tobii app you can re-enable these at any time.\\n\\nStart up Talon. It should recognize your new hardware.\\n\\nEnable eye tracking in the Talon menu.\\n\\nRun the calibration in Talon.\\n\\nNext steps\\n\\nThe Tobii 4c tips page has detailed instructions on how to adjust your environment and behaviour to get a better eye tracking experience.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/tobii_5/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nNothing Happens When I Speak\\n    \\n      Check Your Microphone\\n      Check that Talon is Running\\n      Check that Talon is Awake\\n      Check that Talon is using the Correct Microphone\\n\\nTalon seems to do the wrong thing\\n    \\n      Check the Quality of the Sound Input\\n      Check the Gain\\n      Check that Talon is in the correct mode\\n      Check your Speech Engine\\n      Check your Talon user file sets\\n      Check out Tips for Improving Accuracy\\n      Check the Talon Logs\\n\\nTalon Crashes During Use\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nNothing Happens When I Speak\\n\\nIf you are testing your setup with one of the basic commands and getting no response at all, first check a few fundamentals to help focus the troubleshooting. There are a number of issues at different layers of the setup that could be causing the problem. Your first few steps should help narrow the focus.\\n\\nCheck Your Microphone\\n\\nYour microphone is critical to your setup. If your microphone isn’t working, then none of your voice commands will either. Testing this piece early may save you some time and help narrow down your troubleshooting to either hardware (microphone, audio interface, cables, etc) or software (talon, talon configuration, speech engine, etc).\\n\\nCheck that your computer is using the correct microphone and receiving sound input.\\n\\nOpen System Preferences > Sound > Input. Check that the correct input device is selected and speak into the microphone. Watch the Input level as you speak; you should see the level rising and falling.\\n\\nSelect Start > Settings > System > Sound. In Sound settings, go to Input > Test your microphone. Verify that the correct input device is selected and speak into the microphone. Look for a blue bar that should rise and fall as you speak.\\n\\nIf you are not receiving any sound input, check your ancillary microphone equipment (cables, interfaces, preamps, etc.).\\n\\nCheck your cables and connections.\\n\\nCheck your adapters and/or audio interfaces if you are using them. Examples: Shure X2U XLR-to-USB signal adapter or the DPA d:vice mobile audio interface. Check that they are connected properly and check any settings on the device, e.g., volume, gain, etc.\\n\\nEnsure your microphone is not muted.\\n\\nEnsure that the microphone is pointed at the mouth. This points the axis of maximum sensitivity toward your mouth for best voice isolation (reducing background noise). Some microphones require more careful placement than others.\\n\\nPlace the microphone at a consistent distance away from your mouth. For headset microphones, most speech recognition documentation recommends that you place the boom of the microphone approximately one inch from your face, pointed at a side corner of your mouth. For table microphones, somewhere between six and twelve inches works best (unlike a radio moderator, you do not need to eat the mic).  A proper placement eliminates wind noises from breathing and loud sounds.\\n\\nCheck that Talon is Running\\n\\nAfter you have started the Talon application, look for the Talon icon in the menubar.\\n\\nTalon\\'s icon should show up in the menu bar in the upper right corner of your screen:\\n\\nCheck that Talon is Awake\\n\\nWhen Talon is running, it will be in one of a few different modes. One of these modes is a sleep mode, which will put Talon in a dormant state where it is listening but not responding to commands. While asleep, Talon will only respond to a minimal set of commands, such as talon wake, which will put Talon out of sleep and enable Talon to respond to commands.\\n\\nIf you are trying to use Talon commands and Talon is not responding, make sure Talon is not in sleep mode. The Talon icon in the menubar provides some visual cue as to what mode Talon is in:\\n\\nNote: Depending on your version of Talon, this icon may use color to indicate awake/asleep (green=awake, red=asleep) instead of the slash as pictured above. The slash is used in newer versions.\\n\\nYou can also check the mode by clicking the icon and looking for which mode is set under Speech Recognition.\\n\\nCheck that Talon is using the Correct Microphone\\n\\nYou can check that Talon is using the correct microphone by clicking the Talon icon in the menu bar.\\n\\nTalon\\'s icon should show up in the menu bar in the upper right corner of your screen:\\n\\nYou can also check which which microphone is selected by looking in the talon logs, which are located in ~/.talon/talon.log. Look for a log that looks like this:\\n\\n2020-03-04 15:27:53  INFO Activating Microphone: \"Yeti Nano Analogue Stereo\"\\n\\nIf it’s the wrong one, use the menu in the app tray to change it.\\n\\nTalon seems to do the wrong thing\\n\\nCheck the Quality of the Sound Input\\n\\nIf your computer is receiving sound input, that doesn’t necessarily mean the sound is of good quality. To confirm the sound quality, make a recording of yourself saying Talon commands and play it back. There should be no distortion of the sound and it should be at an optimum volume (not too loud, not too quiet). If you hear any distortion or the volume seems too low or high, check the microphone gain.\\n\\nCheck the Gain\\n\\nIf you are new to using microphone equipment and are not familiar with microphone gain, check out this podcasting blog What is microphone gain?. In simple terms, gain is the input volume of your audio. If the gain is too low, the audio will sound very quiet and Talon may cut you off or hear you at all. If the gain is too high, then sound may get distorted by clipping and Talon may not understand your commands.\\n\\nOne way to test your gain settings is to make an audio recording and listen to how it sounds. The sound should not be overly quiet nor should it sound like you are shouting. Listen for clipping distortions and reduce the gain until there are no distortions.\\n\\nOne tool to make a recording is Audacity, a free and open-source audio editor and recorder that supports Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux. To make a recording with Audacity:\\n\\nInstall and start Audacity,\\n\\nset the correct microphone, and\\n\\npress Record, utter an upbeat “Hello there!”, and stop the recording.\\n\\nListen to the playback: Your voice should sound clear. If it’s too low, increase the gain, if it’s distorted, reduce it.\\n\\nSome audio recording software may also provide visual feedback about whether your gain is at the right level. Look for waveforms that react to your voice. The waveforms should be as big as possible without maxing out.\\n\\nEach microphone and piece of ancillary microphone equipment (audio interface, preamp, audio adapter, etc.) will have a different personality.  Because of that, trust your ears more than the dB reading or the graph of Audacity.\\n\\nCheck that Talon is in the correct mode\\n\\nTalon user file sets can be configured to have multiple modes, which will have a different set of functionality. Most commonly, like in the knausj_talon Talon user file set, there will be two modes: command mode and dictation mode. In command mode, your speech will be mapped to the commands you have configured in your user file set. In dictation mode, your speech will be typed out literally, which is useful if you want to dictate text, like in an email or document.\\n\\nUse dictation mode for free-form speech dictation, like writing an email. (Switch by saying “dictation mode”.)\\n\\nUse command mode for everything else, including dictating individual letters using the alphabet or writing code. (Switch by saying “command mode”.)\\n\\nCheck your Speech Engine\\n\\nCheck that your speech engine has been initialized by looking in the talon log file You should see a line that looks like this:\\n\\nCheck your Talon user file sets\\n\\nCheck you have some valid commands in ~/.talon/user. If it’s empty clone https://github.com/knausj85/knausj_talon and test with some basic commands. Clone the entire repository, not just individual files. Do not combine this repository with other Talon user file sets. Pick one and customize it as needed.\\n\\nTalon automatically tracks changes to files in ~/.talon/user, so that one can change scripts on the fly. This breaks if ~/.talon (or any other part of the path) is a symlink.\\n\\nOn Linux, this can be fixed by replacing the symlink by a bind mount:\\n\\nrm ~/.talon\\n\\nmkdir ~/.talon\\n\\n# or whichever part is a symlink\\n\\nsudo mount\\n\\n-bind /path/to/dot/dir ~/.talon\\n\\nThis can be made permanent by adding the following line to /etc/fstab:\\n\\nCheck out Tips for Improving Accuracy\\n\\nIf commands are intermittently working, check out these tips for improving accuracy.\\n\\nCheck the Talon Logs\\n\\nTalon emits debug information to a log file in your Talon home directory, Windows: %APPDATA%\\\\Talon Mac: ~/.talon. Look for a file with the .log extension, probably named talon.log. The logs will contain useful debug information, like the Talon version or which microphone Talon is using. Syntax errors will also show up in these logs, which make them useful for debugging your Talon user file sets.\\n\\nTalon Crashes During Use\\n\\nTalon should recover from most errors itself, but if it crashes please report it in the Talon Slack with the output log.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/troubleshooting/'}), Document(page_content='Talon Wiki\\n\\nTalon Wiki\\n\\nGetting Started\\n\\nSpeech Engines\\n\\nBasic Usage\\n\\nBasic customization\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nkey() action\\n\\nTroubleshooting\\n\\nHardware\\n\\nTalon user file set list\\n\\nOther Resources\\n\\nFAQ\\n\\nOverview of Talon framework\\n\\n.talon Files\\n    \\n      Context header\\n      Voice commands\\n      Tags, settings, and other capabilities\\n\\nTalon Concepts\\n    \\n      Modules\\n      Contexts\\n      Actions\\n      Lists\\n      Captures\\n      Tags\\n      Apps\\n      Modes\\n      Scopes\\n      Settings\\n\\nTips and tricks\\n    \\n      REPL and logging\\n      Introspection functions\\n      API functions\\n      Built in Talon settings\\n\\nView On Github\\n\\nAdd new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nDelete\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nSource\\n\\nAdd\\n            new\\n\\nEdit\\n\\nUnofficial Talon Docs\\n\\nThis page provides community documentation of the central concepts used for the customization of Talon behaviour. If you want to implement more complicated functionality in Talon or work out how some existing scripts work, then this is the right page. You may prefer the basic usage or basic customization pages if you are a beginner.\\n\\nThe page assumes you have successfully configured Talon to respond to voice commands.\\n\\nOverview of Talon framework\\n\\nTalon is an accessibility platform that provides a scripting layer to connect a range of input hardware/methods to a cross-platform API for interacting with desktop applications. Let’s start by talking about where your configuration/scripting files are stored.\\n\\nlog message). This reloading is convenient when working on scripts/configuration as you generally don’t have to restart Talon for it to pick up changes.\\n\\nSo why do we have two kinds of configuration/scripting files (.py and .talon)? Originally all Talon configuration/scripting was done using Python, but over time it was decided that the addition of a framework specific file type would be beneficial. To a first approximation .talon files provide a succinct way of mapping spoken commands to behaviour. .py files on the other hand provide the implementation of behaviour and other functionality used by .talon files.\\n\\n.talon Files\\n\\nThe primary way to extend talon is using .talon files placed in the user directory. A talon file comes in two parts: a context header defining the circumstances in which the file is active, and a body that implements various behaviors within that context. The body of a talon file can:\\n\\nDefine voice commands.\\n\\nDefine keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\nActivate registered tags or apps and change settings.\\n\\nImplement/override the behavior of actions. However, this is deprecated; you should implement actions in Python files instead.\\n\\nAn example .talon file might look like this:\\n\\nContext header\\n\\nThe context header specifies when the body of the file will be activated. That is, only when the requirements of the header are met will the settings, tags, and commands in the body be available. This enables you to specify commands and behaviour that are only available for specific windows, applications, etc.\\n\\nThe following requirements can be set:\\n\\nrequire specific operating systems; currently either linux, mac, or windows\\n\\nrequire a specific tag\\n\\nonly active for specific talon modes (like command, dictation, sleep et al.)\\n\\nmatch applications by explicitly declared, well-known name\\n\\nmatch applications by name (TODO where does Talon read this out?)\\n\\nmatch applications by executable, like /usr/lib/firefox/firefox or firefox.exe\\n\\nmatch applications by their MacOS bundle, like com.mozilla.Firefox\\n\\nmatch a window title\\n\\nspecify a currently active programming language\\n\\nspecify the particular human language (e.g. pt_BR, en) for the file. Defaults to en if not specified. Currently only needed for multilingual webspeech.\\n\\nmatch the ‘hostname’ of your machine (from the hostname CLI command on Linux/Mac). Useful if you want to have a single set of custom config but have some machine-specific parts.\\n\\nAdditionally, you can create user scopes. scopes allow matching on additional arbitrary string information supplied by user scripts. For example you might write a scope called slack_workspace_name. You’d then be able to make .talon files that only matched a particular Slack workspace by putting a line like ‘user.slack_workspace_name: Talon’ in the header. See the scope concept section below for more information.\\n\\nWe’ve already indicated what requirements and scopes are, so lets move on to the matcher part (on the right of the ‘:’). This can either be a literal string match like title: foo (matching a window whose entire title is ‘foo’), or a regular expression. The regular expression engine essentially uses the Python re.search() function to see if the value of the requirement or scope matches. So for the title: /foo/i example we’d match any window whose title had the string ‘foo’ in it in a case insensitive manner (due to the ‘i’ flag). For requirement types that have multiple values (tag and mode), Talon iterates through each active tag or mode and matches the header line if any of those match the regex or string literal.\\n\\nThe next thing to talk about is what happens when we have multiple lines in the context header. Talon lets you combine these together as a composite matcher following specific rules. In the following examples the comment contains an expression describing what the rule will match, e.g. paint_app or (windows and not notepad_app). In this case the expression would match the when the app paint_app is active or the operating system is windows and the app notepad_app is not active.\\n\\nSo without modifiers, requirements of the same type (e.g. two apps) are OR-ed together. Requirements of different types (e.g. ‘app’ and ‘os’) are AND-ed together. The ‘and’ modifier looks at the previous requirement and merges with it to make a compound expession. The ‘not’ modifier just negates the condition.\\n\\nVoice commands\\n\\nA voice command has the format RULE: BODY, where RULE determines what words activate the command, and BODY defines what the command does when activated:\\n\\nThis command, for example, will press the shortcut alt-shift-down whenever you say either “channel unread next”, “unread next”, or “goneck”.\\n\\nRules\\n\\nRules have a versatile syntax that is like a word based regex:\\n\\nfoo\\n\\nWords\\n\\n“foo”\\n\\n[foo]\\n\\nOptional\\n\\n“foo” or null (nothing)\\n\\nfoo*\\n\\nZero or more\\n\\n“”, “foo”, “foo foo”, …\\n\\nfoo+\\n\\nOne or more\\n\\n“foo”, “foo foo”, …\\n\\nfoo|bar\\n\\nChoice\\n\\n“foo”, “bar”\\n\\n(foo)\\n\\nPrecedence/grouping\\n\\n“foo”\\n\\n{some_list}\\n\\nList\\n\\nDepends on the list.\\n\\n<some_capture>\\n\\nCapture\\n\\nDepends on the capture.\\n\\n^foo\\n\\nStart anchor\\n\\nSee below\\n\\nfoo$\\n\\nEnd anchor\\n\\nSee below\\n\\nRules can be anchored or unanchored. Talon has a system that detects when a user is and isn’t speaking which it uses to break up microphone input into a sequence of ‘utterance blocks’. So if you said “first bit … other … bits” (‘…’ means a sufficiently long pause), then Talon might turn this into three utterance blocks: [“first bit”, “other”, “bits”]. Anchoring a rule requires that it occur at the start or end (or both) of an utterance block.\\n\\nFor example if the following command were added to the knausj Talon user file set ^my command: \"first\" and you said “my command air bat cap” then Talon would insert “firstabc”. “air bat cap my command” on the other hand would only produce “abc” (and maybe a misrecognition) because ‘my command’ was not at the start of your utterance. If other command$: \"second\" were defined and you said “air bat cap other command” you’d get “abcsecond”. If you said “other command air bat cap” you’d just get “second”. Because the command matched and had the $ suffix, the rest of your utterance was thrown away.\\n\\nIn general you shouldn’t anchor rules since it prevents the user from chaining them together (like we were doing with our examples and the air bat cap commands). Aside from special circumstances you really only consider anchoring when you have a command you wouldn’t chain (e.g. switching from command to dictation mode), or you really want to prevent the command from being called by accident.\\n\\nTalonscript Body\\n\\nThe BODY part of a command is implemented in Talonscript, a simple statically typed language. We’ll discuss Talonscript and how it interracts with the RULE part of the command with reference to the following .talon file:\\n\\nIn the above we can see that the lists and captures in the rule part are bound to variables in the Talonscript based on the name of the list/capture. If we use the same lists/capture in a rule multiple times then each use gets a corresponding _1, _2 suffix. If we make a list/capture optional then we have to handle the case where it isn’t included using “or”. Similarly if we have a choice of matches we have to handle the cases where the alternative was picked. Finally, if we match multiple captures/lists (e.g. with ‘+’), then we can refer to the lot of them with the _list suffix. Individual items from the multiple match can be referred to with the _1, _2 suffix as well.\\n\\nIn the above we can see that the lists and captures in the rule part are bound to variables in the Talonscript based on the name of the list/capture. If we use the same lists/capture in a rule multiple times then each use gets a corresponding _1, _2 suffix. If we make a list/capture optional then we have to handle the case where it isn’t included using “or”. Similarly if we have a choice of matches we have to handle the cases where the alternative was picked. Finally, if we match multiple captures/lists (e.g. with ‘+’), then we can refer to the lot of them with the _list suffix. Individual items from the multiple match can be referred to with the _1, _2 suffix as well.\\n\\nIn terms of the Talonscript itself, the syntax can be thought of as a very limited subset of Python. Consider the following file which (as of writing) demonstrates all available syntax. See the inline comments for what everything does:\\n\\nTags, settings, and other capabilities\\n\\n.talon files can do a few other things aside from defining voice commands.\\n\\nThe most common usage after voice commands is to adjust settings. The following changes the given setting values when the context header matches:\\n\\nYou can also activate tags. This snippet activates the user.my_tag tag when the context header matches. This is used reasonably often to enable extra sets of voice commands for the given context.\\n\\nAnother feature is the ability to bind keyboard shortcuts.\\n\\nThe list of available keys you can listen too isn’t well defined, but it is likely a subset of the names on the key() action wiki page.\\n\\nAside from these, additional extra capabilities may be added from time to time. For example in the beta version you can currently define rules for matching facial expressions on OSX and user supplied noises (e.g. a whistle sound) via integration with parrot.py.\\n\\nTalon Concepts\\n\\nIn order to script Talon it is useful to understand the abstractions it uses. Let’s start by giving you a brief overview of how they fit together.\\n\\nAs we have already seen, the Context is a central feature of the Talon framework. A context is the circumstances under which a set of behaviour applies. For example we might only activate some voice commands when the title of the currently focussed window matches a given pattern. The concepts of Tags and Apps, and less commonly Modes and Scopes are all ways of providing information to match against in a Context.\\n\\nThe next key component is the implementation of behaviour via Actions. Two examples are moving the mouse cursor and pasting the contents of the clipboard. Talon comes with some built in actions, but most are defined and implemented in user scripts.\\n\\nOne of the primary modes of input to Talon is through voice commands defined in .talon files. To implement commands containing dynamic ‘variables’ (e.g. ‘allcaps some arbitrary words’) you can utilize Lists and Captures.\\n\\nIn addition to the above we also have the concept of Settings. Built-in and custom settings are used by actions to configure their behaviour (e.g. to change the delay between key presses in the insert() action).\\n\\nThe final concept is the Module. This is used to register particular instances of the above concepts with Talon, and to give them unique names.\\n\\nModules\\n\\nactions,\\n\\nlists,\\n\\ncaptures,\\n\\nscopes,\\n\\ntags,\\n\\nmodes,\\n\\nsettings and well-known\\n\\napplications. In Python, you can construct a module like so:\\n\\nAll Actions, Lists etc. must first be declared via a Module before they can be referenced in .talon or .py files. See the concept sections linked above for how to do this in each case.\\n\\nContexts\\n\\nseveral properties like your OS, the name of the current application, etc.  Within a particular context you can implement/override the behavior of\\n\\nactions, adjust\\n\\nsettings, activate\\n\\ntags, and redefine\\n\\nlists and\\n\\ncaptures. Note that you cannot define new voice commands in Python, that can only be done in\\n\\nIn Python, you can construct a context like so:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nContext\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nWhen initially constructed, a context has no conditions attached, and so it is always active.\\nYou can make this context conditional by setting the matches property:\\n\\nctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"\"\"\\napp: notepad_app\\nos: windows\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nMultiple contexts can be active at any one time, we might have the one mentioned above as well as one with ctx.matches = \"os: windows\". Since contexts can override behavior, Talon has a set of heuristics to work out which context should ‘win’ in the event that two or more override the same behavior. A useful approximation of these heuristics is that contexts with more matching rules will win. This concept can be used to make sure your overrides are used in preference to those implemented elsewhere (e.g. in knausj_talon). For example if we wanted a more specific matcher than the one above we might add in a language: en requirement:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nContext\\n\\nmore_specific_ctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nmore_specific_ctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"\"\"\\napp: notepad_app\\nos: windows\\nlanguage: en\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nSee examples in the Actions, Lists, Captures, and Tags sections for information about using Contexts with those features.\\n\\nActions\\n\\nAn action is a specially registered Python function that can be called by Talon voice commands. The code in .talon files ends up using built in or user defined actions for all its behavior. Consider this example:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\naction_class\\n\\nclass\\n\\nActions\\n\\ndef\\n\\nfind_reverse\\n\\n():\\n\\n\"Begins a reverse search.\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\nmangle\\n\\nstr\\n\\n>\\n\\nstr\\n\\n\"Mangles the input string in the appropriate manner.\"\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n\"__\"\\n\\nThis declares the actions user.find_reverse and user.mangle (all user-defined actions are prefixed with user.). It also gives a default implementation for user.mangle that simply prepends __ to the input. As in this example, all actions must come with a docstring and type annotations for their arguments and return value.\\n\\nWe are also able to override the implementation of actions depending on the context in which they are used. This is useful when the same operation has different keybindings in different applications. For example, the built-in Talon action edit.save is intended to perform the “save file” operation. In most applications this is performed via ctrl-s, but in Emacs it’s ctrl-x ctrl-s. Let’s say we want to override the edit.save action to make it work properly in Emacs and also wanted to implement/override the two actions we declared above. This shows how you can do that:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nContext\\n\\nactions\\n\\n# Define a context that applies when we have an Emacs window focussed\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"app: Emacs\"\\n\\n# Override a single action within the given Context.\\n# Note we don\\'t have to specify type annotations or a docblock when\\n# overriding actions since those are inherited from the definition.\\n\\nctx\\n\\naction\\n\\n\"edit.save\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\nemacs_save\\n\\n():\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\"ctrl-x ctrl-s\"\\n\\n# Override multiple \"user.\" actions within the given context. The names of the class functions correspond to the actions we\\'re overriding.\\n\\nctx\\n\\naction_class\\n\\n\"user\"\\n\\nclass\\n\\nMyEmacsActions\\n\\ndef\\n\\nfind_reverse\\n\\n():\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\"ctrl-r\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\nmangle\\n\\n):\\n\\nif\\n\\n==\\n\\n\"other string\"\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n\"emacs__\"\\n\\nelse\\n\\n# This will call the next most specific action implementation (in our case the\\n\\n# default one specified on the module). This lets you selectively override\\n\\n# existing behavior.\\n\\nreturn\\n\\nactions\\n\\nnext\\n\\nActions are self-documenting. A list of all defined actions can be accessed via the Talon Console with actions.list().\\n\\nLists\\n\\nA list associates sequences of spoken words with strings that can be used in voice commands. This is useful for commands that permit a choice from a list of options. For example, imagine you wanted to say “exception EXCEPTION” and have Talon type in a programming language appropriate exception class name. You could do that using a list as follows:\\n\\nexceptions.py:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nContext\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\nlist\\n\\n\"exception_class\"\\n\\ndesc\\n\\n\"Exception classes\"\\n\\nctx_default\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx_default\\n\\nlists\\n\\n\"user.exception_class\"\\n\\n\"generic exception\"\\n\\n\"Exception\"\\n\\nctx_python\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\n# code.language is a Talon defined scope which can be set to indicate\\n# the programming language you\\'re currently editing\\n\\nctx_python\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"code.language: python\"\\n\\nctx_python\\n\\nlists\\n\\n\"user.exception_class\"\\n\\n\"runtime\"\\n\\n\"RuntimeError\"\\n\\n\"value\"\\n\\n\"ValueError\"\\n\\nctx_java\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx_java\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"code.language: java\"\\n\\nctx_java\\n\\nlists\\n\\n\"user.exception_class\"\\n\\n\"null pointer\"\\n\\n\"NullPointerException\"\\n\\n\"illegal argument\"\\n\\n\"IllegalArgumentException\"\\n\\nThis sets up a list which matches a list of standard exceptions for the target programming language. Note that we can have a different set of item keys in the list for different contexts. Note also that our list (like user defined actions) is prefixed with user. to identify it as custom code.\\n\\nexceptions.talon:\\n\\nWe make use of our list in the above .talon file by referring to it with the curly brace syntax. See the voice commands section for more details about using lists in .talon files.\\n\\nGiven the above files, if we said “exception null pointer” when the “code.language: java” selector was active we’d get the string “NullPointerException” typed in. Saying “exception generic exception” would do nothing in this context, and nor would “exception value”.\\n\\nOne other fact of interest is that there’s no merging of lists if multiple contexts match. This would mean that if the “code.language: java” selector was active, then our list would not contain the “generic exception” item (it would only have “null pointer” and “illegal argument”).\\n\\nBecause list contents can only be replaced in their entirety, end users can have a harder time overriding the list if they want to add one or two more entries. They would need to copy paste the contents of the source list and then add their entries to the end. See the captures section below for a pattern you can use to make this use case easier.\\n\\nCaptures\\n\\nCaptures parse some user-spoken words and run arbitrary Python code to produce an associated result that can be used in voice commands. This is useful for defining reusable “chunks” of grammar that parse your speech in interesting ways. They are also a more extensible option than lists in your public Talon user file sets (see later in this section for more detail).\\n\\nAn example is defining a grammar for playing computer games where a character moves around on a square grid using a d-pad type interface (up, down, up right etc.). We might like to be able say something like “move north east” or “attack west”. This could be implemented as follows:\\n\\ndirections.py:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntyping\\n\\nimport\\n\\nDict\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nactions\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\ncapture\\n\\nrule\\n\\n\"((north | south) [(east | west)] | east | west)\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\ndpad_input\\n\\n>\\n\\nDict\\n\\nstr\\n\\nbool\\n\\n]:\\n\\n\"\"\"\\n    Matches on a basic compass direction to return which keys should\\n    be pressed.\\n    \"\"\"\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n\"up\"\\n\\n\"north\"\\n\\nin\\n\\n\"down\"\\n\\n\"south\"\\n\\nin\\n\\n\"right\"\\n\\n\"east\"\\n\\nin\\n\\n\"left\"\\n\\n\"west\"\\n\\nin\\n\\nmod\\n\\naction_class\\n\\nclass\\n\\nGameActions\\n\\ndef\\n\\ndpad_keydown\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nDict\\n\\nstr\\n\\nbool\\n\\n]):\\n\\n\"Holds down the keys corresponding to the given direction\"\\n\\n# Press all the indicated keys down, exploiting the fact\\n\\n# that the key names in our dictionary match the arrow key\\n\\n# names on the keyboard\\n\\nfor\\n\\nkey\\n\\npressed\\n\\nin\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nitems\\n\\n():\\n\\nif\\n\\npressed\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\nkey\\n\\n:down\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\ndpad_keyup\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nDict\\n\\nstr\\n\\nbool\\n\\n]):\\n\\n\"Releases the keys corresponding to the given direction\"\\n\\nfor\\n\\nkey\\n\\npressed\\n\\nin\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nitems\\n\\n():\\n\\nif\\n\\npressed\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\nkey\\n\\n:up\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\ndpad_move\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nDict\\n\\nstr\\n\\nbool\\n\\n]):\\n\\n\"Moves the character in the given direction\"\\n\\nactions\\n\\nuser\\n\\ndpad_keydown\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nactions\\n\\nuser\\n\\ndpad_keyup\\n\\ndirection\\n\\ndef\\n\\ndpad_attack\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nDict\\n\\nstr\\n\\nbool\\n\\n]):\\n\\n\"Makes the game character attack in the indicated direction\"\\n\\nactions\\n\\nuser\\n\\ndpad_keydown\\n\\ndirection\\n\\n# Assume space is a common \\'perform attack\\' key\\n\\nactions\\n\\nkey\\n\\n\"space\"\\n\\nactions\\n\\nuser\\n\\ndpad_keyup\\n\\ndirection\\n\\nThis code first implements a new capture which matches on any of the compass directions, parses that and returns a data structure describing which directions were indicated. There is also a set of actions included which take this data structure and use it to press the appropriate keys.\\n\\ngame_one.talon:\\n\\nThe above .talon file uses the angle bracket syntax to indicate we want to use the named capture. With these files you could then say something like “move north east” and the up and right keys would be pressed and released, moving your character up and to the right.\\n\\nIn this example we have only set up a simple capture. The ‘rule’ parameter in the @mod.capture annotation actually has the same capabilities as the rule component of a .talon file command. The type of the ‘m’ parameter passed to your capture method behaves similarly to the body in a .talon file. You can use syntax like m.my_list_2 to access the second usage of user.my_list in your rule expression for example. The m parameter can also be accessed as an array of its subcomponents. This was done in the above example (using the in operator to search the array).\\n\\nCaptures vs lists in voice commands\\n\\nIt was mentioned earlier that using captures in the voice commands of your public Talon user file sets is a better option than lists. To see why, consider the <user.symbol_key> capture from knausj_talon. This capture is used in a voice command that lets you press a key by just saying its name (e.g. saying “dot” produces “.”). A partial implementation of that capture is included below:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nContext\\n\\nactions\\n\\napp\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\nlist\\n\\n\"symbol_key\"\\n\\ndesc\\n\\n\"All symbols from the keyboard\"\\n\\nctx\\n\\nlists\\n\\n\"user.symbol_key\"\\n\\n\"dot\"\\n\\n\".\"\\n\\n\"quote\"\\n\\n\"\\'\"\\n\\n\"paren\"\\n\\n\"(\"\\n\\n# ... 100 other key names\\n\\nmod\\n\\ncapture\\n\\nrule\\n\\n\"{user.symbol_key}\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\nsymbol_key\\n\\n>\\n\\nstr\\n\\n\"One symbol key\"\\n\\nreturn\\n\\nsymbol_key\\n\\nThis capture is doing nothing but wrap the symbol_key list, so why is this useful? The reason in this case is the end user might want to extend the list of available keys in all voice commands that are using this capture. If the commands used a list like {user.symbol_key}: key(symbol_key), then to add an extra key they’d need to copy that 100 item list to their new context. Because a capture is used instead (<user.symbol_key>: key(symbol_key)) we can add to the voice command using a file like this:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nContext\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\nlist\\n\\n\"mystuff_symbol_key\"\\n\\ndesc\\n\\n\"extra symbol keys\"\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"app: my_app\"\\n\\nctx\\n\\nlists\\n\\n\"user.mystuff_symbol_key\"\\n\\n\"semi\"\\n\\n\";\"\\n\\nctx\\n\\ncapture\\n\\n\"user.symbol_key\"\\n\\nrule\\n\\n\"{user.symbol_key} | {user.mystuff_symbol_key}\"\\n\\ndef\\n\\nsymbol_key\\n\\n):\\n\\nreturn\\n\\nstr\\n\\nNote that all I needed to do was implement the capture with a new rule parameter to have the extra ‘semi’ option be available to the command in the context of app: my_app.\\n\\nTags\\n\\nBesides concrete features like an application’s name or a window’s title, a context can also select for tags. Tags have a couple of main uses:\\n\\nTags can be used to activate additional voice commands within a particular context. For example knausj_talon has some tab management commands (e.g. tab new) that apply to many applications. Application specific contexts or .talon files can simply enable the tag (and potentially implement the relevant actions) to activate those voice commands.\\n\\nTags can be enabled from Python to activate a set of voice commands given certain conditions. For example the mouse grid activates a tag when it is visible. This tag enables the ‘grid off’ and ‘grid reset’ commands.\\n\\nTo make a tag available, it must first be declared in a module:\\n\\ngeneric_application_features.py:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\n# this declares a tag in the user namespace (i.e. \\'user.tabs\\')\\n\\nmod\\n\\ntag\\n\\n\"tabs\"\\n\\ndesc\\n\\n\"basic commands for working with tabs within a window are available\"\\n\\nNext let’s define a set of generic voice commands we think will apply to all applications with tabs:\\n\\ntabs.talon:\\n\\nFinally, let’s activate these voice commands for the firefox application:\\n\\nfirefox.talon:\\n\\nOf course, the commands we defined in tabs.talon just invoke corresponding actions, so unless the default behavior of those actions is what we want, we’d also need to implement them in a Python file (see Actions). Happily, in this case the default behavior suffices. Tags and actions often go together in this way.\\n\\nThere’s also the option of enabling tags from within Python. To do that you can use a Context instance like this:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nContext\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"app: Firefox\"\\n\\n# You can alter the set of tags whenever you like within your Python\\n# code. The tags will only be applied if your Context is currently active\\n# and they are included in the tags property. Note that you must replace the entire\\n# set of tags at once, you can\\'t individually add and delete them\\n\\nctx\\n\\ntags\\n\\n\"user.tabs\"\\n\\nTags are a commonly used part of the Talon framework. Related but less commonly used are modes and scopes.\\n\\nApps\\n\\nTalon allows you to give a ‘well-known’ name to an app. This lets you decouple the app matcher logic from the places it is used.\\n\\nRegister and identify the ‘fancyedit’ app via a Talon Module in Python - fancyedit.py:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\napps\\n\\nfancyedit\\n\\n\"\"\"\\nos: mac\\nand app.bundle: com.example.fancyedit\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n# you can specify the same app several times; this is the same as specifying several match statements that are OR\\'d together\\n\\nmod\\n\\napps\\n\\nfancyedit\\n\\n\"\"\"\\nos: windows\\nand app.exe: fancyed.exe\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nAdd another possible matcher for fancyedit in a different file than the one the well-known name was defined in - fancyedit_custom.py:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nContext\\n\\nctx\\n\\nContext\\n\\n()\\n\\nctx\\n\\nmatches\\n\\n\"\"\"\\nos: linux\\napp: Xfce4-terminal\\ntitle: /fancyed - tmux/\\n\"\"\"\\n\\nctx\\n\\napps\\n\\n\\'fancyedit\\'\\n\\nUse the well-known app - fancyedit.talon:\\n\\nModes\\n\\nModes are property you can match in your .talon file context header. They are intended for switching on and off large sets of Talon functionality. For example Talon includes the ‘command’, ‘dictation’, and ‘sleep’ modes by default along with a few others. Multiple modes can be active at once.\\n\\nThe built in ‘command’ mode is special in that it is an implicit requirement in all .talon files that haven’t explicitly specified a mode. So this .talon file would be active in command mode:\\n\\nWhereas this one would only be active in dictation mode:\\n\\nWhereas this one would only be active in dictation mode:\\n\\nYou can create custom modes but this is uncommon as Tags are better suited for most purposes. Like tags, multiple modes can be active at once. Unlike Tags, modes cannot be scoped to a particular context; modes always apply globally. The intent is that there should be a small enough number of them that they could be toggled using a short popup menu.\\n\\nSo why might you add a custom mode? The main reason is because you want to disable all normal voice commands so only the ones in your mode are active. An example might be where you were using a full screen computer game, and wanted to eliminate potential conflicts with commands outside the game context.\\n\\nFirst you would declare the new mode in Python:\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\nmode\\n\\n\"single_application\"\\n\\ndesc\\n\\n\"Non-multitasking mode (e.g. computer games)\"\\n\\nThen you might make a couple of generic ‘mode entry’ and ‘mode exit’ commands:\\n\\nNote that I’ve shadowed the existing command mode command from knausj_talon so that it does the right thing when our mode is active.\\n\\nAfter that we could define a set of commands which would be available in our game:\\n\\nScopes\\n\\nScopes allow you to supply additional properties that can be matched in the header of .talon files or by the Context.matches string in Python. This could be used to make the window title from your current virtual machine window available to Talon for example. Another might be to tell Talon which mode your full-screen computer game is in. In practise they are not used very often.\\n\\nYou need to write custom Python code to keep your scope information up to date. The following example implements a scope that makes the current time available as a matcher property.\\n\\ntest.py\\n\\nimport\\n\\ndatetime\\n\\nfrom\\n\\ntalon\\n\\nimport\\n\\nModule\\n\\ncron\\n\\nmod\\n\\nModule\\n\\n()\\n\\nmod\\n\\nscope\\n\\ndef\\n\\nmy_scope_updater\\n\\n():\\n\\n# Sets the user.current_time scope to something like \"04:12 PM\"\\n\\nreturn\\n\\n\"current_time\"\\n\\ndatetime\\n\\ndatetime\\n\\nnow\\n\\n().\\n\\nstrftime\\n\\n\"%I:%M %p\"\\n\\n)}\\n\\n# Re-run the above code every minute to update the scope. You can run\\n# <scope function>.update() from anywhere you like to trigger an update.\\n\\ncron\\n\\ninterval\\n\\n\"1m\"\\n\\nmy_scope_updater\\n\\nupdate\\n\\ntest.talon\\n\\nscopes are ‘global’ in the sense that you can’t override them for particular contexts in the same way as actions. Any file can simply overwrite a particular scope’s value by implementing some python code like the above.\\n\\nYou may have noticed that scopes can emulate the behaviour of tags, except you have to manage any context switches yourself. In practise tags are used far more often than scopes as they’re both simpler to use, and are also self documenting. This leads to the recommendation that if you are able to use a tag for your use-case, then generally you would do that. If you need the string matching behaviour of scopes then you might consider those.\\n\\nSettings\\n\\nSettings allow you to control some of the parameters of your python files by changing their value in a .talon file. This can be used to make a Talon user file set easier to customize for end users, such as exposing the background color of a UI element. It can also be useful to have certain settings change when the context changes, by setting them to different values in different .talon files.\\n\\nSettings are defined on Modules. Each setting has a name, type, default value, and description. The following example shows how to define a setting in python, and save its value in a variable. You can call .get() on the variable to access the current value of the setting.\\n\\nsetting.py\\n\\nNote that the name of the setting (the first argument to mod.setting) in the example included the prefix “my_user_file_set”. All user defined settings names share the same namespace so it’s important to avoid overly generic setting names that may conflict.\\n\\nThe following example shows how you would change the value for that setting in a .talon file. Any number of settings can be defined in a single settings block, but any invalid syntax will prevent the entire block from applying.\\n\\nsetting.talon\\n\\nYou can also set the value of a setting from Python:\\n\\nYou can also set the value of a setting from Python:\\n\\nmyfile.py\\n\\nIt is also possible to register a callback function to be called whenever a setting changes. This is done by calling settings.register() with a setting name and a function to call. If the name string is blank (like in the example below) then the callback function will be called whenever any setting is changed. When the name is not blank the function will only be called when a setting with a matching name is changed.\\n\\nlistener.py\\n\\nTips and tricks\\n\\nThis section contains some additional miscellaneous information which may be useful for developing and debugging Talon scripts.\\n\\nREPL and logging\\n\\nTalon comes with a Python Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) which can be accessed from the Scripting menu. This lets you try out actions and use the introspection functions mentioned below.\\n\\nThere is also a repl executable in the bin subdirectory of your Talon home folder. You can pipe REPL commands into that and they will be executed in the running Talon environment. This is often used as a RPC interface to Talon. For example executing a line like this on Linux would toggle whether Talon is listening to the microphone: bash -c \"echo \\'actions.speech.toggle()\\' | ~/.talon/bin/repl\".\\n\\nTalon also has basic logging functionality. If you have run Talon from the terminal you will have seen the output, but it can also be viewed using the ‘Scripting -> View log’ menu item or directly in the talon.log file in your Talon home folder. To add to the log from your script simply use the Python print() function, though in general this is only used for debugging.\\n\\nIntrospection functions\\n\\nThis section lists some built in methods which are useful for developing or debugging Talon behaviour. The following are all imported by default into the REPL and aren’t really meant to be used outside that context.\\n\\nsim(\"tab close\") - Finds the .talon file that would handle the given command in the current context. If the command is not active in the current context, then it prints an error. Useful for finding the relevant code for a voice command. You might want to paste something like import time;time.sleep(5);sim(\"tab close\") in to the REPL to give you a chance to switch to the appropriate context.\\n\\nmimic(\"say hello world\") - Executes the given voice command like you spoke it in to the microphone. Can be useful to re-run voice commands while editing them so you don’t have to keep saying the same thing.\\n\\nactions.find(\"string\") - Searches the name, documentation, and code implementing an action for the given substring. Prints out a list of matches.\\n\\nactions.list(\"edit\") - Prints out all registered actions matching the given prefix. If no argument is supplied then lists all actions. See the basic customisation page for a trick to copy this output into your clipboard.\\n\\nevents.tail() - If you’re not getting enough information about what Talon is doing from the log file you can take a look at this method. It prints out Talon internal events, user actions called, scope changes etc. to the REPL. For even more logging try the events.tail(noisy=True) flag. You can also print out historical events and filter the events, run help(events.tail) to see the options.\\n\\nregistry.commands, registry.lists etc. - Lets you view the currently active set of commands, lists, actions etc. that Talon is considering.\\n\\nAPI functions\\n\\nTalon provides an API under the talon package allowing you to perform various actions from Python. Some examples are window management and drawing overlays. Talon is closed source, but does provide class, method, and module signatures as .pyi files in the resources/python/lib/python3.9/site-packages/talon/ folder. These files can also be linked to by your IDE to provide autocompletion etc. Note that many of the .pyi files are internally facing, but it’s generally fairly clear what’s intended to be stable and used by user scripts.\\n\\nA quick pointer to some APIs follows:\\n\\n__init__.pyi - The main API functionality is imported here (e.g. Module, Context, actions). This is what you import when you include import talon in your code.\\n\\nui.pyi - window and workspace management functionality and focus change events. OS specific functionality is imported at the top of the file from (linux|mac|windows)/ui.pyi.\\n\\nclip.pyi - Cross platform clipboard monitoring and management.\\n\\ncron.pyi - Periodic tasks, use this for polling or background tasks so as not to block the main Talon thread.\\n\\nscreen.pyi - Monitor/screen management querying functionality (e.g. get dimensions of screen), also screenshot functions.\\n\\nimgui.pyi - A simple GUI system for drawing basic floating windows including text and buttons.\\n\\ncanvas.pyi - A floating canvas implementation with transparency that optionally captures mouse and keyboard events. See also the talon.skia package which provides the drawing functions (based on the Skia library).\\n\\nnoise.pyi - Register for pop and hiss noise events.\\n\\nexperimental/ - This package contains experimental APIs which may change in signature or be removed.\\n\\nctrl.pyi - ‘Low level’ mouse and keyboard event injection. You should prefer using the exposed mouse/keyboard actions rather than this.\\n\\nfs.pyi - Watch files and folders for changes.\\n\\nYou are also able to use almost all of the CPython standard library. So you can use that do do network requests, maths operations, or execute subprocesses for example. Other Python packages like numpy may be included in the Talon distribution as an implementation detail, but are not guaranteed to be included forever.\\n\\nAn escape hatch for this kind of thing is the .venv folder in your Talon home directory. The pip executable in the bin subdirectory of your Talon home directory allows you to install arbitrary Python packages in to that. You’re generally a bit on your own with this and may have difficulty building binary packages. For this reason it is discouraged to ask users of any public package you build to install things in their venv.\\n\\nBuilt in Talon settings\\n\\nIn a .talon file, a settings() block can be used to alter settings, both for Talon and for user modules. For example:\\n\\nwill set the key_wait setting to 1.5 whenever the current application is emacs.\\n\\nThe remainder of this page describes various important settings that you might want to meddle with.\\n\\nThe following three settings, insert_wait, key_hold, and key_wait, can be used to slow down keypresses when dealing with applications that are behaving unreliably (e.g., key presses seem to be jumbled or dropped).\\n\\nIncrease this if characters seem to be jumbled in a specific app when typing whole sentences. Default is 0.\\n\\nIncrease this if you’re playing a game and some keys aren’t registering at all. You should probably increase it in 16ms increments, e.g. set it to 16ms or 32ms.\\n\\nIncrease this if modifier keys are getting dropped or if key presses are misbehaving even with the other two settings (insert_wait and key_hold) tuned. key_wait should be the last resort because it results in the the slowest overall keypress rate. Default is 1.0 in milliseconds.\\n\\nDetermines which speech engine talon uses to recognize input. This is useful for configuring dictation mode to use a different speech engine; for example, ‘webspeech’. See speech recognition engines.\\n\\nThis determines how long a pause Talon waits for before deciding you’ve finished speaking and interpreting what you’ve just said as a sequence of commands. This parameter is generally very important; for example, it determines the the amount of time you can pause between saying ‘phrase’ and the following phrase.\\n\\n    It is measured in seconds; the default is 0.150, i.e. 150 milliseconds. It has been mentioned in #beta that this setting may not always be available as it was offered as a quick fix in Talon 1283 for Talon 1274 cutting input off too soon sometimes.\\n\\nThis project is maintained by TalonCommunity\\n\\nView the Project on Github', metadata={'source': 'https://talon.wiki/unofficial_talon_docs/'})]\n"
